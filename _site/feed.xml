As the regular season winds down, every point is a battle, and this week delivered the high-stakes drama we craved.</p>

<h2 id="the-scramble-for-seeding">The Scramble for Seeding</h2>

<p>With Don Cherry’s having already clinched the top spot, the real action this week was in the congested middle of the standings, as teams jostled for playoff positioning. The Monday/Wednesday Low B division is heading into playoffs hot, with the best-of-two series kicking off on February 25th.</p>

<p>Monday night at St. Mikes Arena, under a typical chilly Toronto February sky, we saw two crucial matchups. First up, the <strong>Flat-Earthers</strong> decisively beat <strong>4 Lines</strong> with a 6-1 victory at 9:00 PM. Flat-Earthers, securing second place, got a multi-goal performance from Ethan Hirst (2G), with Reid Chessell (1G, 1A) and Alex Adolphe (1G, SH) adding to the offense. For 4 Lines, Riley Hanson’s late first-period goal was their lone marker. This loss keeps 4 Lines in 3rd with 18 points, but with a pivotal makeup game against these same Flat-Earthers next week, their seeding is far from set.</p>

<p>Immediately before that, at 8:00 PM, <strong>The Shockers</strong> and <strong>Don Cherry’s</strong> battled to a hard-fought 2-2 tie. Michael Murphy (1G, 1A) and Nik Tsatsos (1G) found the net for Don Cherry’s, while Caden Bower (1G) and Gabe Fischer-Schmidt (1G) answered for The Shockers. The cleanliness of this contest was notable, with no penalties called by Referee Evan Benwell, a rare sight in a high-intensity game. The single point moves The Shockers to 16 points, making them part of a three-way tie for 4th, 5th, and 6th.</p>

<p>Wednesday’s lone game at 7:00 PM saw <strong>The Sahara</strong> pull away from the <strong>Muffin Men</strong> with a 5-2 win at St. Mikes. Wes Martin was a force, notching two goals, including a power-play marker, and an assist. Wil Nenadovic also contributed with a power-play goal. For the Muffin Men, Mitchell Cianfarini and Ryan Irwin scored in the third to narrow the gap. This victory propels The Sahara (17 points) into 4th place, just ahead of The Shockers and Muffin Men (both at 16 points). The implications are immense: The Sahara currently sits in a 3rd vs 4th playoff matchup scenario, leaving The Shockers to face the formidable Flat-Earthers, and the Muffin Men to challenge Don Cherry’s in the 1st vs 6th slot.</p>

<p>The final regular-season makeup game next week between 4 Lines and Flat-Earthers holds the key to locking in these tight lower-bracket matchups. Every shot, every save, and every penalty will matter.</p>

<p>The Monday/Wednesday Low B division kicked off the week with a clear stratification developing at the top, while the middle-of-the-pack scrap remains as tight as the goalies’ five-holes. Under a crisp, typically Canadian February sky, with temperatures hovering near freezing, pucks dropped at St. Mikes and Upper Canada College School Arena.</p>

<p><strong>Don Cherry’s</strong> continued their dominant run, solidifying their top spot with a commanding 9-2 victory over the <strong>Muffin Men</strong> at St. Mikes. While Muffin Men’s Owen Burry and Charles Levy found the net, Don Cherry’s offense was relentless.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This decisive win further cements Don Cherry’s significant lead in the standings, boasting a league-best Goal Differential of +33 and a GFA of 4.47.</p>

<p>The 10 PM slot at St. Mikes saw a rollicking 6-6 tie between <strong>The Sahara</strong> and the <strong>Flat-Earthers</strong>. This back-and-forth affair was a test of endurance and offensive firepower.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Kosta Likourezos of The Sahara was a force, notching a hat-trick and two assists, including the game-tying goal in the third period. For the Flat-Earthers, Anthony Pennino orchestrated much of their attack with a goal and three assists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, at the Upper Canada College School Arena, <strong>The Shockers</strong> edged out <strong>4 Lines</strong> in a tightly contested 4-3 battle. This game, played at the late 10:30 PM slot, was notably more physical. Referees Russell Nichols and Eric Beltrami were busy, calling six penalties in total, highlighting the intensity of the matchup.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Shockers mounted a crucial third-period comeback, propelled by Caden Bower’s goal and three assists, including an assist on Nick Chong’s short-handed marker. For 4 Lines, Adam Miller put up two goals and an assist in a valiant effort.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This win brings The Shockers level on points with The Sahara, both sitting at 15 points, tightening the race for the middle seeds. The Muffin Men’s loss keeps them precariously close, only one point ahead of this surging duo.</p>

<p>This week brought a familiar chill to St. Mikes Arena, but the play on the ice was anything but frozen. Don Cherry’s continued their dominant run, dispatching The Sahara 5-3 on Wednesday night. While Cherry’s secured the win, The Sahara’s Kosta Likourezos and Sam Goldstein each potted a goal and an assist, showing some spark. Koch Tsatsos led the Cherry’s attack with a pair of goals, while Dongyeon Kim added a goal and an assist.</p>

<p>Monday’s slate delivered both a decisive victory and a tightly contested draw. The Flat-Earthers cemented their hold on second place with a 6-3 win over The Shockers.

<p>The Downtown Men’s Hockey League’s Monday/Wednesday Low B division saw some significant shifts this past week, even if not all were earned on the ice. Don Cherry’s solidified their top spot, not with a highlight-reel goal, but an “Official Forfeit” victory over 4 Lines on Monday night at St. Mikes. While a win is a win, it certainly leaves fans wanting more puck drops.</p>

<p>Speaking of more action, The Shockers delivered a dominant performance, shutting out The Sahara 5-0 at Upper Canada College School Arena. The late 10:30 PM start on a chilly Monday, typical of Toronto in late January, didn’t dampen their spirits.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Shockers scored five unanswered goals, with #3 Caden Bower contributing a goal and two assists, including a helper on the short-handed tally by #18 Gabe Fischer-Schmidt.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This commanding win propels The Shockers into a tie with The Sahara in points (15), nudging them ahead with a superior win count.</p>

<p>Wednesday night, Flat-Earthers edged out the Muffin Men 4-2 at St. Mikes. It was a tight battle, with Flat-Earthers’ #5 Reid Chessell opening the scoring. Muffin Men’s #10 Charles Levy kept his team in it, potting both of their goals, showcasing a relentless effort even in defeat. The officiating was light for this contest, with only one minor penalty called against Muffin Men’s Ryan Irwin. In contrast, the Shockers-Sahara game saw a combined five minors, indicating a more physical affair overseen by referees Mark Donohoe and Eric Beltrami.</p>

<h2 id="three-stars-of-the-week">Three Stars of the Week</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>1st Star: Caden Bower (The Shockers)</strong> – A goal and two assists (3 points) in The Shockers’ 5-0 triumph, including a primary assist on the game’s opening goal and a helper on the shorthanded marker. A truly impactful performance.</li>

  <li><strong>3rd Star: Charles Levy (Muffin Men)</strong> – Notched both goals for the Muffin Men against the Flat-Earthers. Despite the loss, Levy’s individual offensive output was commendable.</li>

<p>The week kicked off on Monday at 8:00 PM with <strong>The Shockers</strong> delivering a convincing 7-3 victory over the <strong>Muffin Men</strong>. It was a clean game with no penalties, but The Shockers’ offense was anything but polite. Caden Bower was a force, racking up four goals and two assists. Muffin Men’s Charles Levy responded with two goals in the third, but the deficit was too steep.</p>

<p>Wednesday evening, under the eyes of referees Benwell and Kuchar, brought a pair of compelling contests. At 8:00 PM, top-ranked <strong>Don Cherry’s</strong> battled the <strong>Flat-Earthers</strong> to a hard-fought 5-5 tie. Don Cherry’s saw contributions from Nik Tsatsos and Koch Tsatsos, while Anthony Pennino netted two for the Flat-Earthers, including a crucial equalizer late in the third.</p>

<p>The late game at 10:00 PM saw the biggest upset and a penalty-laden affair as <strong>The Sahara</strong> bested <strong>4 Lines</strong> 5-4.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Sahara’s Kosta Likourezos bagged a hat-trick (3 goals, 2 assists)
This offensive surge was pivotal for The Sahara, who gained two crucial points. 4 Lines’ Jamie Poole, a true productive agitator, scored a goal amidst two minor penalties for Unsportsmanlike Conduct and Interference. This win propels The Sahara into a tie with The Shockers at 17 points, just a hair behind the Muffin Men’s 16 points, making the middle of the pack exceptionally tight.</p>

<p>Amidst brisk January nights at St. Mikes Arena, the DMHL’s Monday/Wednesday Low B division delivered its usual blend of grit and goals. The week’s action notably solidified Don Cherry’s hold on the top spot.</p>

<p>Don Cherry’s extended their reign, making short work of the Muffin Men in an 8-1 rout on Wednesday. Ryan Willms potted a hat-trick and two assists, showcasing Cherry’s league-best goal differential. The Muffin Men’s lone tally, a power play goal from Ryan Irwin, offered little solace in an outing solidifying their lower-tier status.</p>

<p>Monday delivered a tight 6-5 win for 4 Lines over The Shockers. Luke Gravett led the charge for 4 Lines with two goals and two assists, including a crucial shorthanded marker. The Shockers, despite two goals from Maxime Gagnon and a spirited effort, couldn’t close the gap. 4 Lines solidify third, while The Shockers hover precariously near the bottom.</p>

<p>Wednesday’s late 5-5 tie between Flat-Earthers and The Sahara proved a physical affair. Eight penalties were doled out by referees Darcy McNamee and Sonny Martinello, keeping the penalty boxes busy. The Sahara, led by Wes Martin’s two goals and an assist, clawed back to force the tie against a Flat-Earthers squad that saw five different goal-scorers, including Anthony Pennino and Reid Chessell.</p>

<p>Monday, December 22nd, brought a palpable chill to Toronto’s rinks, echoing some unexpected shifts in the Monday/Wednesday Low B standings. The Mattamy Athletic Centre saw some tight contests, but the biggest story unfolded later at the Upper Canada College School Arena, where The Sahara delivered a shockwave.</p>

<p>The Sahara, previously lurking at Rank 6, delivered a stunning 6-0 shutout against the league-leading Don Cherry’s. This wasn’t just a win; it was a statement.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Sahara’s #14 Wes Martin potted a hat-trick, with goals spread across all three periods, setting the tone for their dominant performance. Their first goal came just 1:10 into the first period.
This decisive victory vaulted The Sahara into a tie for 5th place with The Shockers, drastically improving their goal differential. Don Cherry’s, meanwhile, will be keen to erase this memory. The officiating crew of Mark Donohoe and John Hall kept the game flowing smoothly, with zero penalties called.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Earlier, at the Mattamy Athletic Centre, the Flat-Earthers edged out The Shockers 3-2 in a game riddled with penalties.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Flat-Earthers were whistled for five minors, including two on #2 Anthony Pennino, while The Shockers had one.
Despite the parade to the box, Flat-Earthers secured two points, with #5 Reid Chessell notching a goal and an assist. The Shockers’ #44 Nick Chong contributed two assists, but it wasn’t enough.</p>

<p>The Monday/Wednesday Low B division saw some decisive swings this week, particularly impacting the middle of the standings. Don Cherry’s solidified their top spot, while Muffin Men and The Shockers clawed their way up.</p>

<p>Monday night at St. Mikes Arena, Don Cherry’s asserted their dominance with an 8-5 victory over 4 Lines. Koch Tsatsos led the charge with a hat-trick, supported by Michael Murphy and Ben Pirie, each netting a pair.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Don Cherry’s offense was firing on all cylinders with 8 goals, showcasing why they lead the league with a 0.763 Win Percentage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>4 Lines kept it competitive, with Ethan Lowe adding two goals, but couldn’t close the gap. Referees Mike Bonke and Russell Nichols oversaw a game with only one double minor penalty, indicating a relatively clean contest for such a high-scoring affair.</p>

<p>Wednesday saw a pair of games at St. Mikes. In the 9:00 PM slot, The Shockers delivered a resounding 7-1 win against The Sahara. Patrick Mcmullan and Alex Matheson each potted two goals, with Maxime Gagnon, Nick Chong, and Gabe Fischer-Schmidt also finding the back of the net.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Shockers’ offensive outburst was a significant move, improving their goal differential to 0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later at 10:00 PM, The Muffin Men put on a clinic, humbling the Flat-Earthers with an 8-1 victory. Charles Levy was a force with two goals and two assists, while Ryan Irwin and Owen Burry each tallied a goal and two assists. Remarkably, this late-night tilt saw zero penalties called by referees Evan Benwell and Carlos Verde, a testament to pure, unadulterated hockey. The Flat-Earthers, despite strong individual talent, couldn’t find their footing.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“A truly unblemished scoresheet, aside from the obvious goal differential, is a rarity in Wednesday night hockey,” remarked one veteran scout.</p>
