Monday night delivered upsets and high-scoring affairs, subtly reshaping the division’s hierarchy.</p>

<h2 id="the-week-that-was">The Week That Was</h2>

<p>The Monday/Wednesday Low B division saw some notable movement, particularly as <em>The Shockers</em> made a definitive statement in the standings. While Don Cherry’s continues their relentless march, the mid-table jostling is heating up.</p>

<p>Don Cherry’s affirmed their pole position with a commanding 9-2 victory over the <em>Muffin Men</em> at St. Mikes Arena (9:00 PM). Goals from Nik Tsatsos and Cassady Louks, combined with Sean Murphy’s three assists, showcased Cherry’s formidable offensive depth.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Don Cherry’s GFA: 4.47, Goal Differential: +33.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The night’s biggest jolt came from <em>The Shockers</em>, who, despite a busy night for Referees Russell Nichols and Eric Beltrami that saw six minor penalties called, edged out <em>4 Lines</em> 4-3 in a late 10:30 PM tilt at Upper Canada College. Caden Bower’s (1G, 3A) pivotal game-winning goal propelled The Shockers past the Muffin Men in the standings with this crucial win. For 4 Lines, Adam Miller contributed two goals in a losing effort.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <em>The Sahara</em> and <em>Flat-Earthers</em> battled to a thrilling 6-6 draw at St. Mikes (10:00 PM). Kosta Likourezos’ hat-trick for The Sahara was a highlight, matched by Anthony Pennino’s four-point (1G, 3A) effort for the Flat-Earthers, keeping both teams firmly in the hunt for better seeding.</p>

<p>Another intense week in the DMHL’s Monday/Wednesday Low B division saw the top solidify, but the middle pack is in a genuine dogfight for playoff seeding.</p>

<p>Monday at St. Mike’s Arena, the 8:00 PM tilt saw “4 Lines” and “Muffin Men” battle to a 3-3 draw. Goals by Thomas Mchugh, Ellis Gerussi-Turner, and Adam Miller for “4 Lines” were answered by “Muffin Men’s” Aaron Barrett, Cole Singleton, and a clutch “Spare” goal late in the third. Referees Benwell and Nichols kept it clean with just two penalties.</p>

<p>Later, the same officials presided over a penalty-laden 6-3 “Flat-Earthers” victory against “The Shockers” (seven penalties called). Daniel Solomos (2G, 2A) and Anthony Pennino (SHG, 1A) spearheaded the “Flat-Earthers” offense, overcoming “The Shockers’” early strikes from Patrick Mcmullan and Caden Bower.</p>

<p>Wednesday, league-leading “Don Cherry’s” defeated “The Sahara” 5-3. Koch Tsatsos led all scorers this week with 5 points (2G, 3A), while Sam Goldstein netted two for “The Sahara.” Officials Kuchar and McNamee called only two penalties in this contest.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Don Cherry’s” (1st, 29pts) extends their commanding lead, while “Flat-Earthers” (2nd, 20pts) secured their position. The tightness between “4 Lines” (3rd, 18pts) and “Muffin Men” (4th, 16pts) intensifies, making every point crucial. Notably, referees Benwell and Nichols showcased differing penalty volumes across their two assignments this week.</p>

<p>Another week in the DMHL Monday/Wednesday Low B division saw Don Cherry’s solidify their top spot, albeit unconventionally, while The Shockers made a decisive move.</p>

<p>Don Cherry’s claimed an official forfeit victory over 4 Lines on Monday at St. Mikes Arena, boosting their league-leading points tally to 29. While a win is a win, it’s certainly not the ideal way to spend a 10 PM slot.</p>

<p>The Shockers, however, put in the work. They delivered a commanding 5-0 shutout against The Sahara at Upper Canada College School Arena, also a late 10:30 PM start.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Shockers’ Caden Bower contributed a goal and an assist, while Nick Chong, with two assists, played a characteristically robust game, earning an Interference penalty in the 3rd period. Gabe Fischer-Schmidt added a shorthanded marker in the 2nd.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wednesday night, the Flat-Earthers edged out the Muffin Men 4-2 at St. Mikes. Charles Levy’s two goals for the Muffin Men kept it close, but contributions from Anthony Pennino and Ethan Hirst (a goal and an assist each) sealed the win for the Flat-Earthers. This game saw remarkably little whistle, with only one minor penalty called by Referees Evan Benwell and Brad Kuchar. In contrast, the Shockers-Sahara tilt featured five penalties, primarily against The Shockers, indicating a more physical, albeit perhaps less disciplined, affair.</p>

<p><strong>Three Stars of the Week:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>1st Star: Charles Levy (Muffin Men)</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Levy netted both goals for the Muffin Men in their battle against the Flat-Earthers. A two-goal effort, even in a loss, is MVP-worthy.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>2nd Star: The Shockers Goaltending &amp; Defensive Unit</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>A 5-0 shutout against The Sahara speaks volumes. While no single netminder is named, the collective effort was undeniable.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><strong>3rd Star: Nick Chong (The Shockers)</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <p>With two assists and an interference call, Chong embodies the productive agitator, contributing offensively while playing with an edge.</p>

<p>Another week of Monday/Wednesday Low B action saw movement, a few fireworks, and some truly standout performances across the St. Mikes Arena sheets. While Don Cherry’s remains perched atop the standings with a robust 29 points, their lead was slightly chipped into by a resurgent Flat-Earthers squad this past Wednesday. The Sahara, however, made the most significant climb, narrowing the gap on 4 Lines.</p>

<p>Wednesday night delivered a late-game surge at St. Mikes with <strong>The Sahara</strong> besting <strong>4 Lines</strong> in a tight 5-4 affair.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Sahara’s #41 Kosta Likourezos was the undeniable catalyst, bagging a hat trick, including the eventual game-winner at 11:33 in the third period.
His line, with Isaac Jeffers and Yanir Levy, was buzzing all night. This late 10:00 PM game also featured a bit of extra-curricular activity, with both Jamie Poole (4 Lines) and Mitchell Moloney (The Sahara) taking unsportsmanlike minors in the first. Referees Evan Benwell and Brad Kuchar were kept busy, calling four penalties in total, indicating a higher-intensity contest. For 4 Lines, #28 Shane Ferguson and #88 Thomas Hunter put up early markers, and #77 Donald Houston Jr. made it close late.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Earlier that Wednesday, in the 8:00 PM slot, <strong>Don Cherry’s</strong> and the <strong>Flat-Earthers</strong> battled to a thrilling 5-5 tie, a result that keeps Don Cherry’s at #1 but shows the Flat-Earthers aren’t content with their #2 spot.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>#2 Anthony Pennino tallied twice for the Flat-Earthers, displaying the offensive spark needed to compete with the league leaders.
Don Cherry’s #21 Cassady Louks also had a two-goal performance. Only two penalties were called in this one, suggesting a more fluid, high-skill game.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The week kicked off Monday at 8:00 PM, also at St. Mikes, with <strong>The Shockers</strong> dominating the <strong>Muffin Men</strong> in a 7-3 victory.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Shockers’ #3 Caden Bower was virtually unstoppable, potting four goals and adding an assist, a performance that undoubtedly sent a shiver through the rest of the division.
The Muffin Men found some late-game momentum, with #10 Charles Levy scoring twice in the third period, but it was too little, too late. Brad Kuchar and Evan Benwell oversaw a penalty-free game, allowing the talent to shine.</p>

<p>Another week of DMHL action at St. Mikes Arena brought expected dominance, a nail-biting finish, and a spirited tie. Don Cherry’s continued their reign atop the standings, while 4 Lines solidified their position, and the Flat-Earthers and The Sahara scrapped for a point.</p>

<p>Don Cherry’s, still leading the pack with a formidable 29 points, utterly steamrolled the Muffin Men in an 8-1 Wednesday night affair.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Don Cherry’s: GFA 4.47, PP% 23.1%.
Their offensive firepower, particularly from <strong>Ryan Willms</strong> (3G, 2A) and <strong>Sean Murphy</strong> (1G, 2A), was simply overwhelming, proving why their league-best goal differential of +33 is no fluke. The Muffin Men, now with a -7 differential, struggled to find answers against the league leaders, their lone goal coming on the power play from Ryan Irwin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Monday night saw a much tighter contest as 4 Lines edged out The Shockers 6-5. <strong>Luke Gravett</strong> was the catalyst for 4 Lines, potting a hat-trick and adding two assists, including a shorthanded goal in the second period, keeping the Shockers at bay.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Luke Gravett: 3 Goals, 2 Assists.
The Shockers’ <strong>Maxime Gagnon</strong> (2G) and <strong>Josh Pope</strong> (1G, 2A) mounted a strong comeback effort, making it a dramatic finish. Referees Mike Bonke and Shane Bowler managed a game that saw a few penalties but nothing that dictated the final outcome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wednesday’s late 9:00 PM game was a back-and-forth slugfest ending in a 5-5 tie between the Flat-Earthers and The Sahara. The Sahara, down early after three first-period goals from the Flat-Earthers including markers from <strong>Ethan Hirst</strong>, <strong>Reid Chessell</strong>, and <strong>Marcus Simmonds</strong>, clawed their way back. <strong>Wes Martin</strong> led The Sahara with two crucial goals, while <strong>Yanir Levy</strong> added a goal and an assist. The officiating duo of Darcy McNamee and Sonny Martinello had their hands full, calling eight penalties in total across both sides, making it a physical contest to cap off the week.</p>

<p>This week saw a seismic shift at the top of the Monday/Wednesday Low B standings, not in rank, but in perception. The undisputed <strong>Don Cherry’s</strong>, sitting comfortably at 1st with a league-best +33 goal differential, were utterly dominated by <strong>The Sahara</strong>, falling 6-0. This result, played out late at 10:30 PM at the UCC School Arena, pushes The Sahara up to 4th (17 points), leapfrogging the Muffin Men and The Shockers, and injects much-needed parity into the top half.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Sahara’s 6-0 victory over Don Cherry’s was a statement, demonstrating a defensive fortitude (0 GA) and offensive burst (6 GF) that belied their prior ranking.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The Sahara</strong> were relentless, with <strong>Wes Martin</strong> leading the charge, bagging a hat trick and an assist. Not far behind, <strong>Kosta Likourezos</strong> tallied a goal and two assists, showcasing a balanced attack that Don Cherry’s simply couldn’t answer. Notably, referees Mark Donohoe and John Hall kept their whistles silent, calling zero penalties in a surprisingly clean, yet lopsided affair.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a more tightly contested battle unfolded at the Mattamy Athletic Centre at 10:00 PM as <strong>Flat-Earthers</strong> edged out <strong>The Shockers</strong> 3-2. This game, officiated by Sonny Martinello and Brad Kuchar, saw a flurry of penalties, particularly against the Flat-Earthers who accumulated five minors. Despite the penalty trouble, goals from <strong>Ryan Lee</strong>, <strong>Reid Chessell</strong>, and a timely power-play ‘Spare’ goal in the third period secured the win for the Flat-Earthers, who remain 2nd with 22 points. The Shockers’ <strong>Nick Chong</strong> was a playmaker with two assists, but it wasn’t enough.</p>

<p>Earlier at 9:00 PM, also at Mattamy, <strong>4 Lines</strong> edged the <strong>Muffin Men</strong> in a high-scoring 6-5 thriller. <strong>Ryan Fitzgerald</strong> (2G, 1A) and <strong>Ellis Gerussi-Turner</strong> (1G, 1A) were key for 4 Lines, pushing them to 3rd place with 20 points. For the Muffin Men, <strong>Charles Levy</strong> countered with two goals and an assist, but their efforts fell just short, keeping them at 5th. In a stark contrast to their later game, referees Kuchar and Martinello also oversaw this game without a single penalty call.</p>

<h3 id="the-three-stars-of-the-week">The Three Stars of the Week:</h3>

<p>Another week in the Monday/Wednesday Low B division, and while ‘Don Cherry’s’ continued their dominant run, the real narrative unfolded just beneath them, with ‘4 Lines’ making a significant surge to draw even with the ‘Flat-Earthers’ in the race for second place. The mid-season grind is certainly producing some compelling hockey, even as the holiday season approaches.</p>

<p>Don Cherry’s reinforced their top spot with a commanding 6-1 victory over ‘The Shockers’ in a late 10:30PM start at Upper Canada College School Arena. Ryan Willms (2G, 2A) and Koch Tsatsos (1G, 3A) were central to the offensive explosion, proving why their squad maintains a league-leading goal differential. The Shockers’ lone goal came from Maxime Gagnon, a small consolation in an otherwise tough night marked by multiple penalties.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Don Cherry’s demonstrated clinical efficiency, converting opportunities with precision to secure a definitive 6-1 win.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Earlier that Monday at St. Mikes Arena, the ‘Muffin Men’ served up a decisive 5-1 win against ‘The Sahara’. Owen Burry and Cosimo Morin each potted two goals, showcasing a balanced offensive attack. The Sahara’s Jake Goldstein managed to get one past the Muffin Men netminder, but the game largely belonged to the Muffin Men.</p>

<p>The week’s most intriguing matchup was the 8:00 PM clash at St. Mikes, where ‘4 Lines’ battled the ‘Flat-Earthers’ to a hard-fought 4-4 tie. Jamie Poole’s two goals, complemented by Shane Ferguson’s three points (1G, 2A) and Ethan Lowe’s two assists, kept ‘4 Lines’ neck-and-neck with the Flat-Earthers, who saw Anthony Pennino score twice and Ryan Lee contribute a goal and three assists. This single point was enough to elevate ‘4 Lines’ into a tie for second place.</p>

<p>To cap off their impressive week, ‘4 Lines’ also secured a 4-2 win against the newly-listed ‘Pdiym’ in a rare Thursday evening game at the Mattamy Athletic Centre. Thomas Bevilacqua added to the goal tally, while Cam Scott netted both markers for Pdiym. Referee Sonny Martinello maintained a tight ship, calling only one minor penalty for slashing to ‘4 Lines’ Ryan Fitzgerald, keeping the flow of play largely uninterrupted.</p>

<p>The Monday/Wednesday Low B division witnessed a seismic shift and steadfast dominance this week. The biggest story? The Sahara (6th, 15 pts) delivered a stunning 6-4 upset against 4 Lines (3rd, 18 pts), pulling them level in points with The Shockers. While 4 Lines still holds a superior goal differential, this win injected much-needed life into The Sahara’s campaign, demonstrating their potential to disrupt the mid-table.</p>

<p>Monday’s 8:00 PM tilt at St. Mikes Arena saw The Sahara mount a comeback against 4 Lines. Sam Goldstein (2G, 1A) spearheaded the offense, with Derrick Wong (1G, 2A) adding a crucial power-play goal. The game was a test for officials Carlos Verde and Mike Bonke, as 4 Lines’ Elliott Sharp earned a double minor for Head Contact early. Not to be outdone, 4 Lines fought back with shorthanded goals from Ryan Fitzgerald (1G, 1A) and Luke Gravett.</p>

<p>Don Cherry’s (1st, 29 pts) solidified their top spot, overcoming the Flat-Earthers (2nd, 20 pts) 4-2 in a tight 10:30 PM Tuesday battle at UCC School Arena. Sean Murphy (2G, 1A) was the architect, netting a pivotal shorthanded goal in the third period, with Michael Murphy (2A) providing offensive support.</p>

<p>Rounding out the week, The Shockers (5th, 15 pts) delivered a decisive 6-1 victory over the Muffin Men (4th, 16 pts) at St. Mikes Arena on Wednesday at 9:00 PM. Caden Bower (1G, 1A), Nick Chong (1G, 1A), and Josh Pope (2A) led a balanced attack, showcasing a robust team performance that could see them climb the standings.</p>

<p>Another action-packed week in the Monday/Wednesday Low B division has stirred the pot, particularly in the competitive middle of the standings. While Don Cherry’s continues to hold a comfortable lead at the top, securing an 8-5 victory over 4 Lines, it was the <strong>Muffin Men</strong> who truly turned heads. Their dominant 8-1 win against the Flat-Earthers propelled them from 7th to 4th, a significant jump built on offensive efficiency.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Muffin Men’s win percentage now sits at 0.421, a tangible improvement reflective of their scoring surge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Muffin Men’s offensive explosion against the Flat-Earthers was led by <strong>Charles Levy</strong>, who bagged 2 goals and 3 assists for a remarkable 5-point night. Owen Burry (1G, 2A) and Ryan Irwin (1G, 1A) also had multi-point efforts. Meanwhile, The Shockers asserted their authority with a decisive 7-1 triumph over The Sahara, moving them into 5th place, tied on points with The Sahara but with a superior goal differential (0 vs -25). <strong>Patrick Mcmullan</strong> and <strong>Alex Matheson</strong> each netted two goals and two assists for The Shockers, while <strong>Maxime Gagnon</strong> added a goal and two helpers. It appears Wednesday nights at St. Mikes, even the late 9 PM and 10 PM slots, are proving fertile ground for high-octane offense.</p>

<p>On the officiating front, a notable trend of relatively clean play dominated the week. The Muffin Men vs. Flat-Earthers game saw no penalties, a testament to smooth play or perhaps a relaxed whistle from referees Evan Benwell and Carlos Verde. The Shockers-Sahara contest featured just two minors, while the Don Cherry’s and 4 Lines game, overseen by Mike Bonke and Russell Nichols, saw only a single double-minor to Don Cherry’s Ben Pirie, keeping the focus squarely on the run of play.</p>
