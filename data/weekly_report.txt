## The Ice Report: DMHL Week in Review – Early September Scramble Sets the Tone

It's January 14, 2026, and as the hockey world gears up for the dog days of winter, we're taking a look back at some pivotal early-season action in the DMHL. The ice may be frozen, but the competition is red-hot, with teams already starting to carve out their identities. From dramatic comebacks to high-scoring stalemates, the opening weeks of September delivered plenty of moments worth revisiting. Let's dig into the tape.

### The Headlines

*   **Monday night at St. Mikes Arena:** The Sahara staged a thrilling 3-2 comeback victory over The Shockers. Down two goals heading into the second half, the desert dwellers ignited their offense. Derrick Wong got them on the board, followed by Brendan Hancock burying a crucial power-play marker in the third period. Andrew Biggs then provided the game-winner, securing a statement win for The Sahara. The Shockers, despite early goals from Nicolas Fischer-Schmidt and Jeremy White, couldn't close it out, hampered by a late body-contact penalty that proved costly.

*   **Wednesday night at St. Mikes Arena:** Don Cherry's and 4 Lines battled to a hard-fought 3-3 tie in a back-and-forth affair that showcased both teams' offensive firepower. Luke Gravett opened the scoring for 4 Lines, but Don Cherry's kept pace. After trading goals and a power-play marker for Thomas Bevilacqua, Don Cherry's Michael Murphy, ever the opportunist, buried a power-play goal in the dying minutes of the third period to pull his team even. Koch Tsatsos also found the back of the net for Don Cherry's, while Ryan Fitzgerald added to 4 Lines' tally. This one felt like a playoff game in September.

*   **Thursday night at the Mattamy Athletic Centre:** The Muffin Men put on an offensive clinic, outscoring the Flat-Earthers 6-4 in a high-octane contest. Owen Burry led the charge for the Muffin Men with a pair of goals, while Ryan Irwin, Alan Wren, Cosimo Morin, and Daniel Throop each chipped in with singles. The Flat-Earthers countered with goals from Ethan Hirst, Reid Chessell, Anthony Pennino, and Ryan Lee, but their efforts weren't enough to contain the Muffin Men's relentless attack. It was a pure even-strength slugfest, with both teams trading blows for sixty minutes.

### The Tape Study: Discipline vs. Production

The early season often reveals which teams have a handle on their game, both offensively and defensively, and how discipline (or lack thereof) plays a role. Looking at the latest action, some patterns emerge that echo through the season's standings.

Don Cherry's, sitting atop the league, exemplifies the "play smart, stay out of the box" mantra. With a league-low 45 penalty minutes across 15 games, their discipline allows their league-leading offense (65 GF) and potent 21.7% power play to dictate play. Their tie against 4 Lines, where they converted on a power play themselves, shows they can capitalize when opponents falter.

Conversely, teams like The Shockers and Flat-Earthers have seen their penalty minutes climb. The Shockers, with 66 PIMs in 16 games, are near the top in that department, and it arguably cost them against The Sahara. That late body contact penalty created the opportunity for Sahara's go-ahead goal, proving that even recreational hockey hinges on staying out of the sin bin at critical moments. Flat-Earthers, with 61 PIMs in 14 games, also find themselves in the middle of the pack, and while they scored four goals against the Muffin Men, a cleaner sheet might have changed the outcome.

The Sahara, despite a solid 35.0% power play, also carries a higher PIM count (46 in 15 games). While their power play converted for a crucial goal against The Shockers, consistency in discipline will be key to moving up from their current fifth-place standing. It's a fine line between playing gritty and playing foolish, and the best teams manage to walk it.

### Weekly Awards

**Clutch Performer of the Week: Brendan Hancock (The Sahara)**
With his team down 2-0 and desperately needing a spark on Monday night, Brendan Hancock stepped up. His power-play goal in the third period against The Shockers wasn't just a tally on the scoreboard; it was the turning point that sparked The Sahara's comeback, setting the stage for their eventual game-winner. That's the definition of clutch.

**Sin Bin Resident of the Week: The Shockers' 3rd Period Penalty Trouble**
While no single player earned an egregious number of penalties in these recaps, The Shockers collective indiscipline late in their game against The Sahara proved to be their undoing. Giving up a power play opportunity in the third period of a close game is hockey's version of self-sabotage, and it directly led to The Sahara's momentum shift and eventual victory. When the game is on the line, staying out of the box is paramount.

**Under-the-Radar Star: Cosimo Morin (Muffin Men)**
While Owen Burry grabbed the headlines with two goals against the Flat-Earthers, Cosimo Morin's two assists in that same game were instrumental in the Muffin Men's offensive explosion. His vision and playmaking set up key goals, demonstrating the kind of quiet but effective offensive contribution that often gets overlooked but is crucial for team success. Morin finished with a goal and two assists, showcasing an impressive overall offensive output.
