The mid-January air hit different this week. It was that bitter cold that makes you question your life choices walking through the slush-filled UCC parking lot, or dodging potholes on the way to St. Mikes. While the schedule theoretically penciled in some Wednesday action, the tape only shows Monday's skirmishes for the Monday/Wednesday Low B division.

**The Monday/Wednesday Rundown:**

1.  **Monday Jan 19, 10:00 PM, St. Mikes Arena: 4 Lines vs Don Cherry's.** This one was a non-event. 4 Lines forfeited, handing Don Cherry's an automatic 1-0 victory. Less ice time, more time to defrost the car.
2.  **Monday Jan 19, 10:30 PM, UCC School Arena: The Shockers (5) vs The Sahara (0).** A late start in the usually-chilly UCC, but The Shockers were wide awake. Marcus Gwyn-Neumann opened the scoring in the first, assisted by Caden Bower. Bower then netted one of his own, with Nick Chong getting the helper. The second period saw Gabe Fischer-Schmidt bag a shorthanded goal, again with a Bower assist. Levi Tobe made it four in the third, and Maxime Gagnon, assisted by Alex Matheson and Chong, sealed the 5-0 shutout with just 13 seconds left. The Sahara’s Yanir Levy picked up 2 PIMs for high-sticking in the first, while The Shockers managed 8 PIMs spread across four players.

**The Standings Ladder:**
With only two games this week, seismic shifts were limited. Don Cherry's picked up a free two points from the forfeit, further solidifying their hold on the top spot. The Shockers' dominant shutout victory nudged them slightly more comfortably into the upper half of the standings. 4 Lines losing points due to their no-show means the gap between them and the top widens, while The Sahara's cold night didn't help their precarious position.

**The Deep Cut:**
*   **THE PYLON INDEX:** Yanir Levy from The Sahara, who managed a minor penalty for High-Sticking with precisely zero impact on the scoresheet in his team's 5-0 loss. Textbook pylon work.

**The Three Stars:**
*   **1st Star: Caden Bower (The Shockers).** A goal and two assists, including a helper on a shorthanded marker. He factored into more than half of his team's offense in a key shutout victory.
*   **2nd Star: The Shockers' Goaltending/Defense (Team Award).** A 10:30 PM shutout at UCC isn't just luck; it takes commitment from everyone on the ice.
*   **3rd Star: Yanir Levy (The Sahara).** Two minutes for high-sticking, zero points. Just making sure the referee earned their stipend.
