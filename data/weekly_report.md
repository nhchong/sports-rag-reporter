# The Low B Dispatch: Jan 21, 2026 - A Quiet Monday Night on Ice

Welcome back to The Low B Dispatch, your professional-grade reporting for Division 41979, where the late starts at UCC can feel like prime time. Today is Wednesday, January 21, 2026, and we're looking back at a week that was light on on-ice drama but heavy on the implications.

## The Rundown: Shutouts and Forfeits Define the Week

Monday night offered a stark contrast in action. At Upper Canada College, **The Shockers** delivered a decisive 5-0 shutout victory over **The Sahara**. The scoreline tells a story of one team finding its stride and another continuing to search for answers. Meanwhile, at St. Mike's, the puck never dropped for the scheduled match between **4 Lines** and **Don Cherry's**, resulting in a 1-0 forfeit win for the league-leading Cherry's. Sometimes, half the battle is just showing up, especially for a 10:00 PM start.

## Seasonal Trends: The View From Mid-Season

This week's sparse schedule, viewed through the lens of the full season, reveals more than just two results.

**The Heating Up/Cooling Down**: **The Shockers** (Rank 6, 6-10-1) provided the most significant performance shift. Averaging just 3.12 goals for per game, their 5-goal outburst, coupled with a shutout, is a major statement. It pushes their goal differential back into positive territory (+7), suggesting they might be turning a corner despite their overall record. Conversely, **The Sahara** (Rank 5, 5-8-4) continued their offensive slump, getting blanked and adding to their league-worst -27 goal differential. Their struggle to find the back of the net consistently is becoming a defining narrative.

**The Gatekeepers**: **Don Cherry's** (Rank 1, 10-1-6) continues to sit atop the standings, their lone loss now distant in the rearview. The forfeit win, while not earned on the ice, only solidifies their position as the undisputed top dog. Below them, **4 Lines** (Rank 2, 7-6-3) absorbed the forfeit loss, maintaining their grip on second but missing an opportunity to gain ground.

**The Discipline Tracker**: **The Shockers**, despite their commanding victory, accumulated 8 PIMs, including four separate minor penalties. With a league-high 74 PIMs on the season, this indicates a consistent aggressive style that doesn't always hinder their performance, especially when they're firing on all cylinders offensively. **The Sahara** received one high-sticking minor, maintaining their mid-range penalty trend.

**Arena Identity**: With only two games, broad conclusions are difficult. However, UCC's late-night slot saw **The Shockers** come alive. Could it be the relaxed atmosphere of a 10:30 PM game on a Monday, far from the bustling prime-time crowds, that unlocks their offensive potential? Or was it just a bad night for The Sahara?

## The Three Stars

*   **1st Star: Caden Bower (The Shockers)** – Already a points-per-game leader (2.0 Pts/G), Bower showcased his offensive prowess with 2 goals and 1 assist in the 5-0 routing of The Sahara. A standout performance when his team needed a spark.
*   **2nd Star: Michael Murphy (Don Cherry's)** – Although he didn't hit the ice, Murphy still technically registered a win, extending Don Cherry's lead. His season-long consistency (league-leading 26 points) makes him an ongoing force.
*   **3rd Star: The Sahara's Offense** – Zero goals, adding to the league's worst goal differential. It’s a tough look when a team can’t register a single tally against a divisional opponent. Time to find that desert oasis of scoring.
