Alright, another week in the books for the Monday/Wednesday Low B, and if you thought the mid-January slush coating the sidewalks outside St. Mike's was messy, you clearly missed some of the defensive zone coverage *inside* the rink. It's colder than a goalie's glove hand out there (-10°C, wind whipping through your soul as you trudge through the parking lot), but the ice was *hot* for some this week, while others left feeling like they'd spent 45 minutes on a Zamboni.

We're diving deep, folks, into the crucial, earth-shattering statistics of guys who still think a breakaway means they have time for a five-deke move. Because, let's be honest, what else are we going to do with this data? Watch the Leafs?

Here's your definitive Low B Dispatch for the week of January 12th:

**THE RUNDOWN: THIS WEEK'S HIGH (AND LOW) LIGHTS**

1.  **The Shockers Shocked The Muffin Men Early (and Often) on Monday Night.** Kicking off the week at 8:00 PM at St. Mike's, The Shockers put on an offensive clinic against the Muffin Men, rolling to a commanding 7-3 victory. Caden Bower was absolutely dialled in, potting **four goals** in the first two periods alone. The Muffin Men managed to find their offensive rhythm in the third with two goals from Charles Levy and one from Alan Wren, but by then, the game was already packed away like last year's Christmas decorations.
2.  **Don Cherry's and Flat-Earthers Play to a Gritty Draw.** Wednesday night's 8:00 PM tilt at St. Mike's was a back-and-forth affair, ending in a 5-5 tie. Don Cherry's looked to have it in the bag, holding a late lead after Sean Murphy and Koch Tsatsos scored in the third. But the Flat-Earthers, true to their stubborn nature, clawed back. Anthony Pennino scored the crucial equalizer with just **1:30 left on the clock** in the third period. A truly valiant effort, or maybe Don Cherry's just ran out of gas.
3.  **The Sahara Outlasts 4 Lines in Late-Night Marathon.** In the 10:00 PM slot on Wednesday, also at St. Mike's (the refs must have had their sleeping bags ready), The Sahara edged out 4 Lines 5-4. Kosta Likourezos was the offensive engine for The Sahara, bagging a **hat trick**, including what proved to be the game-winning goal just before the halfway mark of the third period. This one felt a little wilder than the others, with some noticeable extracurriculars.
4.  **St. Mike's: Not Quite a Penalty Trap, But 4 Lines Found the Box.** While St. Mike's Arena didn't seem to have a particular "penalty trap" vibe for most teams this week, the same couldn't be said for 4 Lines. In their close loss to The Sahara, 4 Lines racked up 6 PIMs on three separate infractions (two from Jamie Wilson alone), compared to The Sahara's single penalty. Tough to win when you're short-handed, especially when the other team is scoring late.
5.  **The "Late-Night Fade" Was More Like a "Late-Game Grit Check."** We looked for evidence of teams collapsing in the 3rd period of late games, but the data this week doesn't entirely support a universal "10:30 PM fade." While the 10:00 PM 4 Lines game saw the Sahara score the winner in the third, it was the 8:00 PM Don Cherry's vs. Flat-Earthers game that had the truly clutch, tie-making goal in the final two minutes. Seems like cardio is an equal opportunity killer, regardless of puck drop time.

**THE STANDINGS LADDER: SHUFFLE UP AND DEAL**

*   **Don Cherry's** (1st) maintain their top spot with their tie, pushing their points total to 26. Still the team to beat, even when they're coasting.
*   **4 Lines** (2nd) took a loss, which keeps them at 17 points, still firmly in second, but without gaining ground.
*   **Muffin Men** (3rd) losing streak continues, holding at 15 points. They need to figure out their defence.
*   **Flat-Earthers** (4th) picked up a crucial point with their tie, also sitting at 15 points, but holding the tie-breaker over the Muffin Men. That Pennino goal was bigger than it looked.
*   **The Sahara** (5th) bagged a win, moving them to 14 points, breathing down the necks of the middle of the pack. Suddenly, they're looking dangerous.
*   **The Shockers** (6th) also had a big win, climbing to 13 points and showing they're not content with the basement.

**THE THREE STARS OF THE WEEK: GLORY, GUMPTION & GOONERY**

*   ***1st Star: Caden Bower (The Shockers, #3)***
    Four goals in one game, against a struggling Muffin Men team. Doesn't matter who you're playing, four goals is four goals. The guy earned his beer. Or maybe a whole case.
*   ***2nd Star: Kosta Likourezos (The Sahara, #41)***
    A hat trick in a tight, late-night game? That's what we call stepping up. His third tally proved to be the winner, showing some late-game composure that most of us lost about 15 years ago.
*   ***3rd Star (The Donkey): Jamie Wilson (4 Lines, #44)***
    Jamie, two penalties for 4 minutes in a one-goal loss. Unsportsmanlike conduct and body contact in a non-contact league? That's not just a bad night, that's a Tuesday morning apology to the boys for the lost point. Get your head in the game, or at least keep your stick on the ice and your shoulders to yourself.

That's it for this week, folks. Lace 'em up, stay hydrated (with water, ideally), and maybe practice your cardio in between shifts. This isn't the pros, but we'll treat it like it is.
