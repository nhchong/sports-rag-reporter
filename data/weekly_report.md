## The Low B Dispatch: Week 17 Report – Cherry's Still King, But Chaos Reigns Below

Alright, folks, another week in the books, and while the top of the standings hasn't budged, the mid-tier is starting to look like a demolition derby. Let's break down what the numbers are telling us.

### The Big Story: Cherry's Cruising, Flat-Earthers on the Edge

**Don Cherry's** (10-1-6, 26 pts) continues their dominant run. With a league-leading +30 goal differential and a robust 4.18 Goals For Average, they're not just winning, they're making a statement. They're playing disciplined hockey too, sitting with a respectable 47 PIMs total. It's their league to lose right now.

The real dogfight is for those precious middle spots. **4 Lines** (7-6-3, 17 pts) and the **Flat-Earthers** (7-6-3, 17 pts) are deadlocked in points, but let's be real, these are two very different teams. 4 Lines boasts a +6 GD, playing responsible hockey. The Flat-Earthers, however, are operating on a whole different plane. With a ghastly -7 GD and a league-high 63 PIMs, they're living proof that chaotic energy can still snag points. Their 9.5% power play isn't doing them any favours either; imagine how many more points they'd have if they could convert on the man-advantage instead of just collecting penalties.

Down the ladder, **The Sahara** (5-8-4, 14 pts) is a puzzle. They're dead last in Goals Against and GD (-27), yet their special teams are surprisingly elite: a league-best 25.9% PP and 91.7% PK. It's clear they can execute when the whistle blows, but getting to that point seems to be the issue. Meanwhile, **The Shockers** (6-10-1, 13 pts) continue to lead the league in penalty minutes with a staggering 74 PIMs. If they want to climb out of the basement, they'll need to spend less time in the box and more time playing hockey.

### Data-Driven Discrepancies

Looking at individual performances, **Charles Levy** of the Muffin Men is a pure offensive machine. Tied for the league lead in points with 26 (16G, 10A) through 14 games, what really stands out is his pristine **0 PIMs**. That's efficiency, folks. Compare that to **Anthony Pennino** of the Flat-Earthers, who's also an offensive force with 18 points (11G, 7A) but carries a league-leading **17 PIMs**. It's the classic good-cop, bad-cop scenario on the scoresheet, and it perfectly reflects their respective teams' disciplined vs. chaotic vibes.

Also worth noting is **Shane Ferguson** from 4 Lines. He's got 20 points (8G, 12A) in just 9 games, giving him a ridiculous **2.22 Pts/G**. If he was playing a full schedule, he'd be running away with the scoring title. Keep an eye on him.

### The Officials – More Whistles, More Questions

The sheer volume of penalty minutes for teams like The Shockers (74 PIMs) and Flat-Earthers (63 PIMs) isn't just a coincidence. While we don't have play-by-play breakdowns to scrutinize every call, these numbers indicate one of two things: either these teams are incredibly undisciplined, or the refs are calling a tighter game when they're on the ice. Given the disparity in PIMs across the league, it leans heavily towards **undisciplined play**. Maybe it's time for some of these guys to take a deep breath before the stick work starts, or we'll see more power plays for the opposition than actual 5-on-5 hockey.

### The Grind of the Season

With a few new teams making single-game appearances this week, the core of the league is past the halfway point. The ice is getting heavier, the bodies are getting tired, and the tempers are flaring. We're entering the true grind, where mental toughness and discipline will separate the contenders from the pretenders. No excuses about late starts or cold rinks now, it's all about showing up and performing.

### The Low B Dispatch Three Stars of the Week

Based strictly on the numbers, here are your standout performers:

**⭐ First Star: Charles Levy (Muffin Men, F)**
*14 GP, 16 G, 10 A, 26 Pts, 0 PIM*
Pure, unadulterated offense with zero trips to the sin bin. Levy is a beacon of productive, clean hockey, tying for the league lead in points without costing his team a single penalty minute. That’s MVP quality.

**⭐⭐ Second Star: Shane Ferguson (4 Lines, F)**
*9 GP, 8 G, 12 A, 20 Pts, 4 PIM*
His 2.22 Pts/G is unmatched across the league, putting up 20 points in significantly fewer games than the top scorers. Ferguson is a dynamic force who single-handedly elevates 4 Lines when he's on the ice.

**⭐⭐⭐ Third Star: Anthony Pennino (Flat-Earthers, F)**
*14 GP, 11 G, 7 A, 18 Pts, 17 PIM*
The quintessential 'Productive Agitator'. Pennino consistently finds the scoresheet with 18 points, but he also leads the league in PIMs among top scorers. He gets under the skin of the opposition while still delivering key offensive contributions. Love him or hate him, you can't ignore him.

That's the dispatch for this week, folks. Lace 'em up tight, play smart, and we'll catch you next time.
