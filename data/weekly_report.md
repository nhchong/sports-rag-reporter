# The Forfeit Foul, Bower's Bomb, and Sahara's Sandstorm of Inconsistency

Alright, fellas, another week in the books, and let me tell ya, this one had more twists than a pre-game pretzel. The big story? Don Cherry's, still sitting pretty atop the pile, snagged two freebie points with a forfeit win. Gotta love it when the league hands you a W, but let's be real, it ain't quite the same as earning it in the trenches. Does it make their 26 points feel a little less, well, *earned*? You bet your bottom dollar it does.

### The Good, The Bad, and The Straight-Up Donkey

First off, let's talk about the **4 Lines** crew. Forfeiting a game against the league leaders, **Don Cherry's** (Game ID 1176618, St. Mikes, 10:00 PM)? What are we doing here, boys? That's not just a loss, that's disrespect to the game, to the beer league gods, and frankly, to your columnists who have to dissect this mess. Don Cherry's took the easy 1-0 win, extending their lead, but it feels hollow, like celebrating a goal that went in off a hot dog vendor.

Now, for actual hockey that happened. The **Shockers** had themselves a week, putting the league on notice. First, they absolutely dusted **The Sahara** 5-0 (Game ID 1176619, UCC, 10:30 PM). A late puck drop at UCC, but The Shockers clearly showed up ready to play. The Sahara? Looked like they were still at the bar. **Caden Bower** was an absolute wrecking ball for The Shockers, putting up 4 goals in their 7-3 shellacking of the **Muffin Men** (Game ID 1173851, St. Mikes, 8:00 PM). Four goals! And he tacked on another goal and two assists in that shutout victory. Kid's on fire.

Speaking of the **Muffin Men**, gotta give some love to **Charles Levy**. The man is a one-man wrecking crew, bagging two goals against Flat-Earthers (Game ID 1176629, St. Mikes, 10:00 PM) and a hat trick against the Shockers. Five goals in two games. The problem? His team went 0-2 this week. Charles, you need some help, buddy. That's like being the only guy in a five-person tug-of-war pulling in the right direction.

Then there's **The Sahara**. Man, what a Jekyll and Hyde week for them. Got blanked by The Shockers, looking like road cones out there, then turn around and beat **4 Lines** 5-4 in a tight one (Game ID 1173867, St. Mikes, 10:00 PM). Big ups to **Kosta Likourezos** for a monstrous hat trick and two apples in that win. But then they tied the **Flat-Earthers** 5-5 (Game ID 1172319, St. Mikes, 9:00 PM). Consistency, boys, it's a thing. You can't be a contender one night and a no-show the next.

The **Flat-Earthers** played a couple of barnburners, tying Don Cherry's 5-5 (Game ID 1173865, St. Mikes, 8:00 PM) and the Sahara 5-5. They also picked up a 4-2 win against the Muffin Men. They’re a scrappy bunch, making every game a fight, but they’re giving up too many goals.

### The Stripes Report: Let the Boys Play (Sometimes)

Referee duo Evan Benwell and Brad Kuchar were everywhere this week, working multiple games. In the Flat-Earthers vs. Muffin Men game (ID 1176629), they kept a pretty tight lid on things, with only one minor. But then in the 4 Lines vs. Sahara game (ID 1173867), these same refs decided a few guys needed to cool off. Matching unsportsmanlike minors to **Jamie Poole** (4 Lines) and **Mitchell Moloney** (The Sahara)? Sounds like two hotheads chirping each other into the box. Good call by the refs to nip that in the bud. Later in the week, in The Sahara vs. Flat-Earthers tie (ID 1172319), referees Darcy McNamee and Sonny Martinello decided to get in on the action, calling 8 penalties. The flow of that game must have been choppier than a dollar store steak.

### This Week's Low B Stars

**1st Star: Caden Bower (The Shockers)**
*5 Goals, 2 Assists in 2 Games, including a 4-goal explosion and contributing to a shutout. Enough said. The kid was absolutely dialed in.*

**2nd Star: Charles Levy (Muffin Men)**
*5 Goals in 2 Games (2G, 3G). While his team took the L, Levy showed up to play. He's doing everything he can to drag those Muffin Men into the win column.*

**3rd Star: Kosta Likourezos (The Sahara)**
*1 Hat Trick, 2 Assists in a single game (Game ID 1173867). When the Sahara needed a hero, Kosta delivered the goods, putting up 5 points to secure a crucial win.*
