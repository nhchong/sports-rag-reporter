**THE LOW B DISPATCH - WEEKLY SLAPSHOT**

Alright, boys and girls, settle in. It’s Senior Columnist time, and the numbers don't lie. This week, we're dissecting the good, the bad, and the unnecessarily penalized. Let's get to it.

### The Big Story: Cherry Picking & The Mid-Pack Mosh Pit

Look, there's **Don Cherry's**. Then there's everyone else. With a dominant 10-1-6 record and a league-leading 26 points, they’re not just winning; they’re steamrolling with a ridiculous +30 Goal Differential. Their 4.18 Goals For Average (GFA) isn't just good, it's a statement. They're playing a different game right now.

The real grind is happening in the middle. **4 Lines** and the **Flat-Earthers** are locked in a dead heat with 17 points apiece. But let’s be real, these teams are built differently. While 4 Lines clocks in with a respectable +6 GD and an 84.2% PK, the Flat-Earthers are scratching and clawing with a -7 GD, trying to defy gravity and the score sheet. Their 63 PIM also suggests a team that might be losing its cool when things aren't going their way.

Further down, **The Sahara** is a puzzle. They boast the league's best Power Play at 25.9% – lethal with the man advantage. Yet, they sit 5th, primarily because they’ve given up a league-high 75 goals against. You can't outscore everyone, fellas. Tighter D, plain and simple, or those PP heroics are just lipstick on a pig.

Down at the bottom, we've got a couple of new faces, **Arctic Dolphins** and **Chiefs**, who've each skated in one game for a tie. **Wolfpack** and **Pdiym** also only have one game under their belts, both losses. Too early to tell if they're depth charge material or just shaking off the rust.

### Data-Driven Discrepancies: Who’s Pulling the Wagon?

Let’s talk individual brilliance, because some of you are clearly dragging entire teams.

**Shane Ferguson** from **4 Lines** is an absolute anomaly. Nine games played, 20 points (8G, 12A). That's a mind-boggling **2.22 Pts/G**. He's not just productive; he's *absurdly* efficient. If he played a full season, we'd be talking about record books.

**Charles Levy (Muffin Men)** and **Michael Murphy (Don Cherry's)** are tied for the total points lead with 26 each in 14 games (1.86 Pts/G). Consistent, reliable, and exactly what you need from your top guns. Murphy’s production on the league-leading Don Cherry’s isn't surprising, but Levy carrying the Muffin Men (who are sitting at 4th) with a 0 Goal Differential is a serious heavy lift.

Keep an eye on **Caden Bower** from **The Shockers**. Another part-timer, but he's got 14 points (6G, 8A) in only 7 games. That’s 2.0 Pts/G. When he shows up, he shows up big.

Then there's **Cole Nead** on the **Muffin Men**. Nine assists, zero goals in 13 games. Pure playmaker, pure setup man. That's a dedicated pass-first guy right there, likely a key cog on the power play or breakout.

And for the guys who love to chirp as much as they score, **Anthony Pennino** of the **Flat-Earthers** leads his team with 18 points (11G, 7A), but he's also racked up 17 PIM. Productive, but definitely pushing the envelope.

### The Officials: Ghosts in the Machine?

Alright, gang, the weekly play-by-play data on specific calls is a ghost town right now. So, no specific gripes or praises for the stripes this week. However, the overall team penalty minutes tell a story of their own. **The Shockers** are leading the league in PIM with 74, closely followed by the **Flat-Earthers** with 63. If you're wondering why your team isn't climbing the standings, maybe check the penalty box door. You can't win from there, boys.

### Vibe & Venue: Not in the Cards

Unfortunately, the data on arena-specific vibes or game times isn't available this week. We can't tell you if the early morning ice is cursed or if the late-night beer league brings out the best (or worst) in everyone. We'll get that intel to you when we have it. Until then, assume every rink is a cold sheet of opportunity.

### THE LOW B DISPATCH THREE STARS OF THE WEEK

Strictly by the numbers, these fellas earned their post-game pizza slice.

*   **1st Star: Shane Ferguson (4 Lines)**
    *   **The Data:** 20 Points (8G, 12A) in just 9 Games Played, for an astounding 2.22 Pts/G.
    *   **The Breakdown:** The dude is a human highlight reel. Even with fewer games than most, his per-game production is off the charts. He's single-handedly swinging games for 4 Lines. MVP material, no question.

*   **2nd Star: Sean Murphy (Don Cherry's)**
    *   **The Data:** 22 Points (8G, 14A) in 15 Games Played, 1.47 Pts/G, with 2 Game-Winning Goals.
    *   **The Breakdown:** A huge part of why Don Cherry's is so dominant. He's not just a scorer; he's a prolific playmaker with 14 assists and chips in with GWGs. His all-around offensive impact for the league's top team makes him a standout.

*   **3rd Star: Anthony Pennino (Flat-Earthers)**
    *   **The Data:** 18 Points (11G, 7A) in 14 Games Played, 1.29 Pts/G, and 17 Penalty Minutes.
    *   **The Breakdown:** This is your quintessential productive agitator. He’s putting up serious points, leading his team in goals, and he's doing it while spending a solid amount of time in the sin bin. He's getting under opponents' skin, and he’s still filling the net. You love to hate him, but you can’t deny his impact.

That’s the lowdown for this week, folks. Keep those sticks on the ice, and the numbers will follow. See you next week.
