Low B's Ladder Rungles: Shockers Ascend, Don Cherry's Dominance Undeniable
Monday night delivered upsets and high-scoring affairs, subtly reshaping the division's hierarchy.

## The Week That Was

The Monday/Wednesday Low B division saw some notable movement, particularly as *The Shockers* made a definitive statement in the standings. While Don Cherry's continues their relentless march, the mid-table jostling is heating up.

Don Cherry's affirmed their pole position with a commanding 9-2 victory over the *Muffin Men* at St. Mikes Arena (9:00 PM). Goals from Nik Tsatsos and Cassady Louks, combined with Sean Murphy's three assists, showcased Cherry's formidable offensive depth.

The night's biggest jolt came from *The Shockers*, who, despite a busy night for Referees Russell Nichols and Eric Beltrami that saw six minor penalties called, edged out *4 Lines* 4-3 in a late 10:30 PM tilt at Upper Canada College. Caden Bower's (1G, 3A) pivotal game-winning goal propelled The Shockers past the Muffin Men in the standings with this crucial win. For 4 Lines, Adam Miller contributed two goals in a losing effort.

Meanwhile, *The Sahara* and *Flat-Earthers* battled to a thrilling 6-6 draw at St. Mikes (10:00 PM). Kosta Likourezos' hat-trick for The Sahara was a highlight, matched by Anthony Pennino's four-point (1G, 3A) effort for the Flat-Earthers, keeping both teams firmly in the hunt for better seeding.
