Post-Season Punch: Early Leads and Tight Races Define Round 1's Opening Salvo
February 28, 2026

The Downtown Men's Hockey League's Monday/Wednesday Low B division launched into its postseason this past Wednesday at St. Mike's Arena, delivering a mix of dominant performances and nail-biting finishes. Three pivotal Game 1 matchups have set the stage, with early "Race to Three" leads and a tight "Lucky Loser" field already taking shape.

### Don Cherry's Charges Ahead, Sahara Sees Red

Top-seeded **Don Cherry's** made a resounding statement in their 7:00 PM tilt against the **Muffin Men**, securing a decisive 5-1 victory. Dongyeon Kim was instrumental, bagging a goal and two assists, while Michael Murphy and Sean Murphy each contributed a goal and an assist. Jack Pirie and Sam Pasich rounded out the scoring, with Conor Pang adding two assists. This potent offensive display included two power-play goals, demonstrating their regular season prowess. Cosimo Morin notched the lone marker for the Muffin Men, assisted by Daniel Throop and Connor Douglas. Don Cherry's now sit at 2 points in the series, needing just a tie or win in Game 2 to advance.

The 9:00 PM matchup saw **The Sahara** overpower **4 Lines** in a 6-4 contest. Six different players — Derrick Wong, Mac Savage, Kosta Likourezos, Wil Nenadovic, Andrew Biggs, and Brendan Hancock — found the back of the net for The Sahara, showcasing their depth. Adam Miller responded with two goals for 4 Lines, while Thomas Bevilacqua added one, and Shane Ferguson potted a shorthanded tally. Aidan O'Brien assisted on two goals for 4 Lines. The Sahara now holds a 2-point advantage, positioning themselves for a Game 2 clinch.

### Flat-Earthers and The Shockers Play to a Deadlock

In the tightest series opener, **Flat-Earthers** and **The Shockers** battled to a 1-1 tie in their 8:00 PM game. Flat-Earthers' Marcus Simmonds opened the scoring in the first period, assisted by Ethan Hirst. The Shockers quickly answered through Alex Matheson, with Levi Tobe and Kamil Paris collecting assists. The score held firm, ensuring both teams earn a point. This stalemate sets up a pivotal Game 2, where a victory for either side will clinch the series.

> **Series Math: The Road to Round 2**
>
> *   **Don Cherry's (2 pts) vs Muffin Men (0 pts):** Don Cherry's needs 1 point (tie or win) in Game 2. Muffin Men must win Game 2 to force OT.
> *   **The Sahara (2 pts) vs 4 Lines (0 pts):** The Sahara needs 1 point (tie or win) in Game 2. 4 Lines must win Game 2 to force OT.
> *   **Flat-Earthers (1 pt) vs The Shockers (1 pt):** This series is dead even. A Game 2 win guarantees advancement; a tie sends them to sudden death OT and potentially a shootout.

> **The Lucky Loser Landscape**
> After Game 1, the picture for the 'Lucky Loser' spot is coming into focus. With Don Cherry's and The Sahara both taking commanding leads (2 points, +4 GD and +2 GD respectively), **Muffin Men** (-4 GD) and **4 Lines** (-2 GD) are currently the teams with zero points. Should both teams lose their series in Game 2, 4 Lines holds the early edge for the Lucky Loser based on their superior goal differential. However, the Flat-Earthers vs The Shockers series could also produce a strong loser depending on Game 2's outcome. Every goal, every save, and every penalty in Game 2 will carry immense weight for those looking for a second chance.
