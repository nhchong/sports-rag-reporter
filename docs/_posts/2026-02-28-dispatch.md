Clinchers, Ties, and the Early Lucky Loser Outlook

Don Cherry's and The Sahara take commanding leads as Flat-Earthers and The Shockers find themselves deadlocked after Game 1 of the Monday/Wednesday Low B playoffs.

### Playoff Round 1 Recaps

Playoff hockey arrived Wednesday at St. Mikes Arena, delivering a mix of decisive wins and a penalty-filled stalemate. The atmosphere was palpable, a refreshing contrast to the routine grind of the regular season.

**Don Cherry's (5) vs. Muffin Men (1)**
The top-seeded Don Cherry's wasted no time asserting dominance. Michael Murphy opened their account with a powerplay goal in the second period, assisted by Conor Pang, adding to an even-strength tally from Jack Pirie in the first. Sean Murphy also chipped in with a powerplay marker. Despite an early even-strength goal from Muffin Men's Cosimo Morin, Don Cherry's showcased why they finished atop the standings. They now hold a commanding 2 points in the series; a tie in Game 2 punches their ticket to Round 2. Muffin Men, currently at 0 points, face a must-win scenario to force overtime.

**The Sahara (6) vs. 4 Lines (4)**
In a high-octane affair, The Sahara outlasted 4 Lines to take a 2-point series lead. The Sahara saw contributions across the board, including goals from Derrick Wong, Mac Savage, Kosta Likourezos, Wil Nenadovic, Andrew Biggs, and Brendan Hancock. 4 Lines' Adam Miller put up a valiant two-goal effort, with Shane Ferguson adding a shorthanded tally, but it wasn't enough. The Sahara now sits at 2 points; a tie in Game 2 will see them advance. 4 Lines, with 0 points, need a regulation victory to extend their playoff hopes.

**Flat-Earthers (1) vs. The Shockers (1)**
If you thought playoff hockey meant tight, disciplined affairs, then you missed Wednesday night's dust-up between the Flat-Earthers and The Shockers. This contest at St. Mikes Arena concluded in a 1-1 draw, with Marcus Simmonds scoring for the Flat-Earthers and Alex Matheson finding the net for The Shockers. The game featured a staggering 16 penalty minutes combined, notably a double-minor for high-sticking to The Shockers' Caden Bower and a pair of minors to Flat-Earthers' Brandon Sanders. Referees Evan Benwell and Brad Kuchar certainly earned their stripes. Both teams sit at 1 point apiece, making Game 2 a winner-take-all skirmish in regulation or an inevitable overtime showdown.

### Lucky Loser Projections

While it’s premature to declare anyone "lucky," the current frontrunner for that coveted Round 2 reprieve is 4 Lines. Their narrow 6-4 loss against The Sahara leaves them with a manageable -2 goal differential. The Muffin Men, suffering a 5-1 defeat, are currently further back with a -4 goal differential. The Flat-Earthers and The Shockers, having tied their opener, are not in the Lucky Loser pool yet, but Game 2 will determine who might join the race.
