**The Low B Dispatch: Monday/Wednesday Low B - Week in Review**

Well, folks, sometimes the most compelling hockey narrative is... no hockey at all. This past week in the DMHL Monday/Wednesday Low B division felt less like a full-contact sport and more like a collective sigh, as the ice remained quiet. With no games played, our usual deep dive into cross-crease passes, officiating calls, or arena vibes is on hold.

However, a lull in action provides a perfect opportunity to reassess the broader landscape. Don Cherry's continues its dominant run atop the standings, their 27 points and league-best +26 goal differential a testament to consistent performance. The gap between second-place Flat-Earthers (19 points) and fourth-place Muffin Men (16 points) remains a tight three-point race, with 4 Lines nestled in between. Every point will matter as we head into the back half of the season. The Sahara and The Shockers are battling for positioning, currently sitting with 14 and 13 points respectively, still very much in the mix if they can string some wins together. We also tip our hats to Arctic Dolphins and Pdiym, patiently awaiting their full campaign to unfold.

On the individual front, Michael Murphy (Don Cherry's) leads the pack with 28 points, showcasing why his team is top-tier. Not far behind is Charles Levy (Muffin Men) with 26 points. Keep an eye on Shane Ferguson (4 Lines); his 2.22 Pts/G in just 9 games is a masterclass in efficiency, suggesting significant impact whenever he laces up. For a true productive agitator, Anthony Pennino (Flat-Earthers) has been a force with 19 points and a division-leading 17 PIM, blending skill with a willingness to get under opponents' skin.

**The Low B Dispatch Three Stars of the (Non-Gaming) Week:**
*   **1st Star: Michael Murphy (Don Cherry's)** – Leading scorer, the offensive cornerstone of the top team.
*   **2nd Star: Shane Ferguson (4 Lines)** – A genuine standout, delivering exceptional 2.22 Pts/G in limited appearances.
*   **3rd Star: Anthony Pennino (Flat-Earthers)** – With 19 points and a division-high 17 PIM, he embodies the productive agitator.
