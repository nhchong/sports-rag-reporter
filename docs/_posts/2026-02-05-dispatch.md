## The Week's Rundown

The Monday/Wednesday Low B division kicked off the week with a clear stratification developing at the top, while the middle-of-the-pack scrap remains as tight as the goalies' five-holes. Under a crisp, typically Canadian February sky, with temperatures hovering near freezing, pucks dropped at St. Mikes and Upper Canada College School Arena.

**Don Cherry's** continued their dominant run, solidifying their top spot with a commanding 9-2 victory over the **Muffin Men** at St. Mikes. While Muffin Men’s Owen Burry and Charles Levy found the net, Don Cherry's offense was relentless.
> Don Cherry's offense was a full-team effort, with Cassady Louks bagging two goals and an assist, and Nik Tsatsos adding a pair. Sean Murphy was the architect, tallying three assists.

This decisive win further cements Don Cherry's significant lead in the standings, boasting a league-best Goal Differential of +33 and a GFA of 4.47.

The 10 PM slot at St. Mikes saw a rollicking 6-6 tie between **The Sahara** and the **Flat-Earthers**. This back-and-forth affair was a test of endurance and offensive firepower.
> Kosta Likourezos of The Sahara was a force, notching a hat-trick and two assists, including the game-tying goal in the third period. For the Flat-Earthers, Anthony Pennino orchestrated much of their attack with a goal and three assists.

Meanwhile, at the Upper Canada College School Arena, **The Shockers** edged out **4 Lines** in a tightly contested 4-3 battle. This game, played at the late 10:30 PM slot, was notably more physical. Referees Russell Nichols and Eric Beltrami were busy, calling six penalties in total, highlighting the intensity of the matchup.
> The Shockers mounted a crucial third-period comeback, propelled by Caden Bower’s goal and three assists, including an assist on Nick Chong’s short-handed marker. For 4 Lines, Adam Miller put up two goals and an assist in a valiant effort.

This win brings The Shockers level on points with The Sahara, both sitting at 15 points, tightening the race for the middle seeds. The Muffin Men's loss keeps them precariously close, only one point ahead of this surging duo.
