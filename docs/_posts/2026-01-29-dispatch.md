***The Low B Dispatch***
*January 29, 2026 – Monday/Wednesday Low B Division*

## Shakers' Woes Continue as Flat-Earthers Ascend

Another week of DMHL action at St. Mikes saw some movement in the standings, though the top spot remains firmly in Don Cherry's grip. The narrative this week was less about seismic shifts and more about teams either solidifying their positions or struggling to find their footing in the mid-week grind.

Don Cherry's continued their dominant run with a 5-3 victory over The Sahara on Wednesday. Despite giving up a first-period goal to Kosta Likourezos, Don Cherry's found their rhythm, with Dongyeon Kim tying it up in the second. The third period saw a flurry, with goals from Jack Pirie, Michael Murphy, and a pair from Koch Tsatsos. The Sahara’s Sam Goldstein netted two in the final frame, keeping things interesting. Don Cherry’s did collect two minor penalties for tripping and hooking, indicating some referee attention, but it didn't disrupt their overall offensive output.

Monday night brought a penalty-filled affair as the Flat-Earthers clashed with The Shockers, ultimately prevailing 6-3. The Flat-Earthers truly capitalized on special teams; Reid Chessell scored on the power play, while Anthony Pennino and Daniel Solomos each notched short-handed goals. The Shockers' Caden Bower tried to keep his team in it with two goals, but seven combined penalties in the second period, including a bench minor for Delay of Game against The Shockers, undeniably impacted the game's flow and outcome. This high penalty volume shows the refs were not shy, and the Flat-Earthers effectively translated discipline issues into goals.

Earlier Monday, 4 Lines and the Muffin Men battled to a 3-3 draw. Aaron Barrett opened the scoring for the Muffin Men, but 4 Lines responded with goals from Thomas Mchugh, Ellis Gerussi-Turner, and Adam Miller. The Muffin Men rallied in the third with goals from Cole Singleton and an unlisted spare, ultimately sharing the points. 4 Lines accumulated two late penalties for tripping and slashing, making for a tense final minute.
