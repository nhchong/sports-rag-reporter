## Division Recap

This week brought a familiar chill to St. Mikes Arena, but the play on the ice was anything but frozen. Don Cherry's continued their dominant run, dispatching The Sahara 5-3 on Wednesday night. While Cherry's secured the win, The Sahara's Kosta Likourezos and Sam Goldstein each potted a goal and an assist, showing some spark. Koch Tsatsos led the Cherry's attack with a pair of goals, while Dongyeon Kim added a goal and an assist.

Monday's slate delivered both a decisive victory and a tightly contested draw. The Flat-Earthers cemented their hold on second place with a 6-3 win over The Shockers. This game was a lively affair, with Referees Evan Benwell and Russell Nichols calling seven penalties, hinting at the competitive edge. The Flat-Earthers capitalized, notably with a short-handed goal from Anthony Pennino and another from Daniel Solomos, who finished with two goals. Brandon Sanders was instrumental for the Flat-Earthers, tallying a goal and two assists. For The Shockers, Caden Bower notched a pair of goals in a losing effort.

Meanwhile, the 8 PM Monday slot saw 4 Lines and the Muffin Men battle to a 3-3 draw. Both teams traded blows, with the Muffin Men's Aaron Barrett, Cole Singleton, and the well-known "Spare" finding the net. 4 Lines responded with goals from Thomas Mchugh, Ellis Gerussi-Turner, and Adam Miller, who also added an assist. The tie keeps 4 Lines in third but denies them two crucial points in their pursuit of the Flat-Earthers.
