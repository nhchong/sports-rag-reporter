## Monday/Wednesday Low B: Mid-Pack Melee Heats Up

Another intense week in the DMHL's Monday/Wednesday Low B division saw the top solidify, but the middle pack is in a genuine dogfight for playoff seeding.

Monday at St. Mike's Arena, the 8:00 PM tilt saw "4 Lines" and "Muffin Men" battle to a 3-3 draw. Goals by Thomas Mchugh, Ellis Gerussi-Turner, and Adam Miller for "4 Lines" were answered by "Muffin Men's" Aaron Barrett, Cole Singleton, and a clutch "Spare" goal late in the third. Referees Benwell and Nichols kept it clean with just two penalties.

Later, the same officials presided over a penalty-laden 6-3 "Flat-Earthers" victory against "The Shockers" (seven penalties called). Daniel Solomos (2G, 2A) and Anthony Pennino (SHG, 1A) spearheaded the "Flat-Earthers" offense, overcoming "The Shockers'" early strikes from Patrick Mcmullan and Caden Bower.

Wednesday, league-leading "Don Cherry's" defeated "The Sahara" 5-3. Koch Tsatsos led all scorers this week with 5 points (2G, 3A), while Sam Goldstein netted two for "The Sahara." Officials Kuchar and McNamee called only two penalties in this contest.

> "Don Cherry's" (1st, 29pts) extends their commanding lead, while "Flat-Earthers" (2nd, 20pts) secured their position. The tightness between "4 Lines" (3rd, 18pts) and "Muffin Men" (4th, 16pts) intensifies, making every point crucial. Notably, referees Benwell and Nichols showcased differing penalty volumes across their two assignments this week.
