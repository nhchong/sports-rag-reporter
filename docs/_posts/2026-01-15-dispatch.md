The Low B Dispatch - Monday/Wednesday Low B

# Shockwaves, Sahara Surges, and a Standoff at St. Mikes

Another week of DMHL Monday/Wednesday Low B action has tightened the mid-table, proving points are harder to come by than fresh ice time at 8 PM. While Don Cherry's maintains their comfortable lead, the race for playoff positioning is heating up, particularly amongst the 4th, 5th, and 6th seeds after a dynamic week.

## Weekly Rundown & The Ref's Whistle

Monday kicked off with **The Shockers** delivering a resounding 7-3 victory over the **Muffin Men** at St. Mikes Arena. Caden Bower was the undisputed star, potting four goals, an offensive outburst that significantly bolstered The Shockers' standing. Remarkably, this high-scoring affair saw zero penalties.

Wednesday evening brought a thrilling 5-5 draw between league leaders **Don Cherry's** and the second-place **Flat-Earthers**. Anthony Pennino led the Flat-Earthers with two goals and an assist, while Michael Murphy assisted twice for Don Cherry's in a game that lived up to its billing. Referees Brad Kuchar and Evan Benwell kept the whistle largely in their pockets, with only two minor penalties assessed.

Later Wednesday, **The Sahara** edged out **4 Lines** 5-4 in a late game. Kosta Likourezos shone for The Sahara with a hat-trick and an assist, driving his team to a crucial two points and leapfrogging The Shockers in the standings. Jamie Poole (4 Lines) and Mitchell Moloney (The Sahara) traded unsportsmanlike conduct minors early, part of a four-penalty night. The late 10 PM slot, combined with the referee duo of Kuchar and Benwell working their second game of the night, perhaps contributed to a bit more friction.

## This Week's Three Stars

*   **1st Star: Caden Bower (The Shockers)** - Four goals against the Muffin Men. Sheer offensive dominance that powered his team to a decisive win.
*   **2nd Star: Isaac Jeffers (The Sahara)** - Registered two crucial assists in a tight 5-4 victory. His consistent playmaking, with 1G, 5A on the season prior to this week, highlights his vital facilitating role.
*   **3rd Star: Anthony Pennino (Flat-Earthers)** - Two goals and one assist in a 5-5 tie. His offensive output, combined with his league-leading 17 PIM, embodies the productive agitator.
