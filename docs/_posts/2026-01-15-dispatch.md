## Low B's Week: Shockers Roll, Sahara Climbs, Cherry's Hold Court

Another week of Monday/Wednesday Low B action saw movement, a few fireworks, and some truly standout performances across the St. Mikes Arena sheets. While Don Cherry's remains perched atop the standings with a robust 29 points, their lead was slightly chipped into by a resurgent Flat-Earthers squad this past Wednesday. The Sahara, however, made the most significant climb, narrowing the gap on 4 Lines.

Wednesday night delivered a late-game surge at St. Mikes with **The Sahara** besting **4 Lines** in a tight 5-4 affair.
> The Sahara's #41 Kosta Likourezos was the undeniable catalyst, bagging a hat trick, including the eventual game-winner at 11:33 in the third period.
His line, with Isaac Jeffers and Yanir Levy, was buzzing all night. This late 10:00 PM game also featured a bit of extra-curricular activity, with both Jamie Poole (4 Lines) and Mitchell Moloney (The Sahara) taking unsportsmanlike minors in the first. Referees Evan Benwell and Brad Kuchar were kept busy, calling four penalties in total, indicating a higher-intensity contest. For 4 Lines, #28 Shane Ferguson and #88 Thomas Hunter put up early markers, and #77 Donald Houston Jr. made it close late.

Earlier that Wednesday, in the 8:00 PM slot, **Don Cherry's** and the **Flat-Earthers** battled to a thrilling 5-5 tie, a result that keeps Don Cherry's at #1 but shows the Flat-Earthers aren't content with their #2 spot.
> #2 Anthony Pennino tallied twice for the Flat-Earthers, displaying the offensive spark needed to compete with the league leaders.
Don Cherry's #21 Cassady Louks also had a two-goal performance. Only two penalties were called in this one, suggesting a more fluid, high-skill game.

The week kicked off Monday at 8:00 PM, also at St. Mikes, with **The Shockers** dominating the **Muffin Men** in a 7-3 victory.
> The Shockers' #3 Caden Bower was virtually unstoppable, potting four goals and adding an assist, a performance that undoubtedly sent a shiver through the rest of the division.
The Muffin Men found some late-game momentum, with #10 Charles Levy scoring twice in the third period, but it was too little, too late. Brad Kuchar and Evan Benwell oversaw a penalty-free game, allowing the talent to shine.

**The Three Stars of the Week:**

1.  ***Caden Bower (The Shockers, Forward)***: Four goals and an assist in a dominant 7-3 win. An MVP-caliber performance.
2.  ***Kosta Likourezos (The Sahara, Forward)***: A clutch hat trick, including the game-winning goal, to propel his team to a crucial 5-4 victory.
3.  ***Anthony Pennino (Flat-Earthers, Forward)***: Two goals in a high-stakes 5-5 tie against the top-ranked Don Cherry's, proving instrumental in securing a valuable point for his squad.
