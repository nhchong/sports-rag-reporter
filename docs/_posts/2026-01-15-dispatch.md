## Week in Review

The week kicked off on Monday at 8:00 PM with **The Shockers** delivering a convincing 7-3 victory over the **Muffin Men**. It was a clean game with no penalties, but The Shockers' offense was anything but polite. Caden Bower was a force, racking up four goals and two assists. Muffin Men's Charles Levy responded with two goals in the third, but the deficit was too steep.

Wednesday evening, under the eyes of referees Benwell and Kuchar, brought a pair of compelling contests. At 8:00 PM, top-ranked **Don Cherry's** battled the **Flat-Earthers** to a hard-fought 5-5 tie. Don Cherry's saw contributions from Nik Tsatsos and Koch Tsatsos, while Anthony Pennino netted two for the Flat-Earthers, including a crucial equalizer late in the third.

The late game at 10:00 PM saw the biggest upset and a penalty-laden affair as **The Sahara** bested **4 Lines** 5-4.
> The Sahara's Kosta Likourezos bagged a hat-trick (3 goals, 2 assists)
This offensive surge was pivotal for The Sahara, who gained two crucial points. 4 Lines' Jamie Poole, a true productive agitator, scored a goal amidst two minor penalties for Unsportsmanlike Conduct and Interference. This win propels The Sahara into a tie with The Shockers at 17 points, just a hair behind the Muffin Men's 16 points, making the middle of the pack exceptionally tight.

## The Three Stars of the Week

*   **1st Star: Caden Bower (The Shockers)** - 6 Points (4 Goals, 2 Assists). Bower's four-goal performance powered The Shockers to a commanding win.

*   **3rd Star: Jamie Poole (4 Lines)** - 1 Goal, 4 PIM. A gritty effort, contributing on the scoresheet and leaving his mark on the physical Wednesday night cap.
