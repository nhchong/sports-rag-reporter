## Low B Weekly Wrap: Muffin Men Rise, Shockers Shake Up the Middle Tier

Another action-packed week in the Monday/Wednesday Low B division has stirred the pot, particularly in the competitive middle of the standings. While Don Cherry's continues to hold a comfortable lead at the top, securing an 8-5 victory over 4 Lines, it was the **Muffin Men** who truly turned heads. Their dominant 8-1 win against the Flat-Earthers propelled them from 7th to 4th, a significant jump built on offensive efficiency.

> The Muffin Men's win percentage now sits at 0.421, a tangible improvement reflective of their scoring surge.

The Muffin Men's offensive explosion against the Flat-Earthers was led by **Charles Levy**, who bagged 2 goals and 3 assists for a remarkable 5-point night. Owen Burry (1G, 2A) and Ryan Irwin (1G, 1A) also had multi-point efforts. Meanwhile, The Shockers asserted their authority with a decisive 7-1 triumph over The Sahara, moving them into 5th place, tied on points with The Sahara but with a superior goal differential (0 vs -25). **Patrick Mcmullan** and **Alex Matheson** each netted two goals and two assists for The Shockers, while **Maxime Gagnon** added a goal and two helpers. It appears Wednesday nights at St. Mikes, even the late 9 PM and 10 PM slots, are proving fertile ground for high-octane offense.

On the officiating front, a notable trend of relatively clean play dominated the week. The Muffin Men vs. Flat-Earthers game saw no penalties, a testament to smooth play or perhaps a relaxed whistle from referees Evan Benwell and Carlos Verde. The Shockers-Sahara contest featured just two minors, while the Don Cherry's and 4 Lines game, overseen by Mike Bonke and Russell Nichols, saw only a single double-minor to Don Cherry's Ben Pirie, keeping the focus squarely on the run of play.

### The Low B Three Stars of the Week:

*   **1st Star: Charles Levy (Muffin Men)** – A spectacular 5-point performance (2 goals, 3 assists) in the Muffin Men’s resounding 8-1 victory. He was simply unstoppable.
*   **2nd Star: Sean Murphy (Don Cherry's)** – Orchestrated much of Don Cherry's attack with 3 assists in their 8-5 win over 4 Lines, demonstrating exceptional playmaking vision.
*   **3rd Star: Ben Pirie (Don Cherry's)** – Contributed 2 goals and an assist for 3 points in a winning effort, all while racking up a double-minor for slashing—the very definition of a productive agitator.
