**The Low B Lowdown: When the Offense Gets Off the Leash**

### Goal Explosions and Standings Shifts Define Week's Action

The Downtown Mens Hockey League's Monday/Wednesday Low B division treated fans to a high-octane week, where the scoreboard lit up more than a Christmas tree in Yonge-Dundas Square. Teams are jockeying for position as we head deeper into the season, with significant shifts across the board. While powerhouses like Don Cherry's continue their dominant run, the mid-table is a genuine battleground.

On Monday at St. Mikes Arena, **Don Cherry's** reaffirmed their top spot with an 8-5 victory over **4 Lines**. Koch Tsatsos led the charge for Cherry's with a hat-trick (3G, 1A), while Ben Pirie (2G, 1A) added offensive punch. A lone double-minor for slashing on Pirie was the only real intervention from referees Bonke and Nichols, allowing for a free-flowing game. **4 Lines** showcased resilience, with Ethan Lowe netting two goals and Ellis Gerussi-Turner assisting on both, even with a "Spare" player finding the scoresheet.

Wednesday's double-header, also at St. Mikes, saw goalies needing a stronger espresso. The 9 PM slot featured **The Shockers** dismantling **The Sahara** 7-1. Patrick Mcmullan (2G, 2A) and Alex Matheson (2G, 1A) were instrumental for The Shockers. Nolan Klumak's roughing minor for The Sahara and Nick Chong's interference penalty for The Shockers were the only infractions, expertly managed by referees Verde and Benwell who let the game breathe.

The 10 PM cap to the week saw **Muffin Men** deliver a resounding 8-1 defeat to the **Flat-Earthers**. Charles Levy was simply sublime for the Muffin Men, racking up 5 points (2G, 3A). Owen Burry (1G, 2A) and Ryan Irwin (1G, 1A) also had multi-point nights. The Flat-Earthers managed just one goal from Aaron Johnson. Interestingly, this game was played entirely without penalties, a testament to its one-sided nature, with Verde and Benwell maintaining a discreet presence.

This week's results further solidified Don Cherry's lead (27 points) and saw the Muffin Men climb to 16 points, closing the gap on Flat-Earthers (19 points) and 4 Lines (18 points). The Shockers (13 points) also gained ground on The Sahara (14 points), setting up a compelling second half of the season.

### This Week's Three Stars

1.  **Charles Levy (Muffin Men):** An MVP performance with 5 points (2G, 3A) in a single, dominant game. Levy was the architect of the Muffin Men's 8-1 rout, a truly standout offensive display.
2.  **Koch Tsatsos (Don Cherry's):** Lit the lamp three times and added an assist for 4 points. His hat-trick was the offensive cornerstone in Don Cherry's high-scoring victory.
3.  **Ben Pirie (Don Cherry's):** The quintessential productive agitator, contributing 3 points (2G, 1A) while also logging a double-minor for slashing. Clearly, he believes in making his presence felt on both the scoresheet and, shall we say, in the discussions with the opposition.
