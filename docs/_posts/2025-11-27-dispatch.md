### Week in Review: Nov 24-26

The Monday/Wednesday Low B division saw some decisive swings this week, particularly impacting the middle of the standings. Don Cherry’s solidified their top spot, while Muffin Men and The Shockers clawed their way up.

Monday night at St. Mikes Arena, Don Cherry's asserted their dominance with an 8-5 victory over 4 Lines. Koch Tsatsos led the charge with a hat-trick, supported by Michael Murphy and Ben Pirie, each netting a pair.
> Don Cherry's offense was firing on all cylinders with 8 goals, showcasing why they lead the league with a 0.763 Win Percentage.

4 Lines kept it competitive, with Ethan Lowe adding two goals, but couldn't close the gap. Referees Mike Bonke and Russell Nichols oversaw a game with only one double minor penalty, indicating a relatively clean contest for such a high-scoring affair.

Wednesday saw a pair of games at St. Mikes. In the 9:00 PM slot, The Shockers delivered a resounding 7-1 win against The Sahara. Patrick Mcmullan and Alex Matheson each potted two goals, with Maxime Gagnon, Nick Chong, and Gabe Fischer-Schmidt also finding the back of the net.
> The Shockers' offensive outburst was a significant move, improving their goal differential to 0.

Later at 10:00 PM, The Muffin Men put on a clinic, humbling the Flat-Earthers with an 8-1 victory. Charles Levy was a force with two goals and two assists, while Ryan Irwin and Owen Burry each tallied a goal and two assists. Remarkably, this late-night tilt saw zero penalties called by referees Evan Benwell and Carlos Verde, a testament to pure, unadulterated hockey. The Flat-Earthers, despite strong individual talent, couldn't find their footing.
> "A truly unblemished scoresheet, aside from the obvious goal differential, is a rarity in Wednesday night hockey," remarked one veteran scout.
