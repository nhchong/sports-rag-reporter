The Playoff Picture Clears (Mostly): A Week of Seismic Seeding Shifts
As the regular season winds down, every point is a battle, and this week delivered the high-stakes drama we craved.

## The Scramble for Seeding

With Don Cherry's having already clinched the top spot, the real action this week was in the congested middle of the standings, as teams jostled for playoff positioning. The Monday/Wednesday Low B division is heading into playoffs hot, with the best-of-two series kicking off on February 25th.

Monday night at St. Mikes Arena, under a typical chilly Toronto February sky, we saw two crucial matchups. First up, the **Flat-Earthers** decisively beat **4 Lines** with a 6-1 victory at 9:00 PM. Flat-Earthers, securing second place, got a multi-goal performance from Ethan Hirst (2G), with Reid Chessell (1G, 1A) and Alex Adolphe (1G, SH) adding to the offense. For 4 Lines, Riley Hanson's late first-period goal was their lone marker. This loss keeps 4 Lines in 3rd with 18 points, but with a pivotal makeup game against these same Flat-Earthers next week, their seeding is far from set.

Immediately before that, at 8:00 PM, **The Shockers** and **Don Cherry's** battled to a hard-fought 2-2 tie. Michael Murphy (1G, 1A) and Nik Tsatsos (1G) found the net for Don Cherry's, while Caden Bower (1G) and Gabe Fischer-Schmidt (1G) answered for The Shockers. The cleanliness of this contest was notable, with no penalties called by Referee Evan Benwell, a rare sight in a high-intensity game. The single point moves The Shockers to 16 points, making them part of a two-way tie for 5th and 6th.

Wednesday's lone game at 7:00 PM saw **The Sahara** pull away from the **Muffin Men** with a 5-2 win at St. Mikes. Wes Martin was a force, notching two goals, including a power-play marker, and an assist. Wil Nenadovic also contributed with a power-play goal. For the Muffin Men, Mitchell Cianfarini and Ryan Irwin scored in the third to narrow the gap. This victory propels The Sahara (17 points) into 4th place, just ahead of The Shockers and Muffin Men (both at 16 points). The implications are immense: The Sahara currently sits in a 3rd vs 4th playoff matchup scenario, leaving The Shockers to face the formidable Flat-Earthers, and the Muffin Men to challenge Don Cherry's in the 1st vs 6th slot.

The final regular-season makeup game next week between 4 Lines and Flat-Earthers holds the key to locking in these tight lower-bracket matchups. Every shot, every save, and every penalty will matter.

## The Three Stars of the Week

**1st Star: Wes Martin (The Sahara)**
> 2 Goals, 1 Assist, 1 Power Play Goal. Martin’s offensive outburst was directly responsible for securing a crucial two points for The Sahara, propelling them up the standings and dictating potential playoff matchups.

**2nd Star: Ethan Hirst (Flat-Earthers)**
> 2 Goals. Hirst's pair of goals helped the Flat-Earthers to a commanding win, solidifying their second-place position heading into the playoffs.

**3rd Star: Michael Murphy (Don Cherry's)**
> 1 Goal, 1 Assist. Even in a tie, Murphy's steady offensive contribution ensures Don Cherry's continues to roll, maintaining their top-seed momentum.
