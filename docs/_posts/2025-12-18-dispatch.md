## Low B Showdown: 4 Lines Cracks Second, Don Cherry's Keeps Cruising

Another week in the Monday/Wednesday Low B division, and while 'Don Cherry's' continued their dominant run, the real narrative unfolded just beneath them, with '4 Lines' making a significant surge to draw even with the 'Flat-Earthers' in the race for second place. The mid-season grind is certainly producing some compelling hockey, even as the holiday season approaches.

Don Cherry's reinforced their top spot with a commanding 6-1 victory over 'The Shockers' in a late 10:30PM start at Upper Canada College School Arena. Ryan Willms (2G, 2A) and Koch Tsatsos (1G, 3A) were central to the offensive explosion, proving why their squad maintains a league-leading goal differential. The Shockers' lone goal came from Maxime Gagnon, a small consolation in an otherwise tough night marked by multiple penalties.

> "Don Cherry's demonstrated clinical efficiency, converting opportunities with precision to secure a definitive 6-1 win."

Earlier that Monday at St. Mikes Arena, the 'Muffin Men' served up a decisive 5-1 win against 'The Sahara'. Owen Burry and Cosimo Morin each potted two goals, showcasing a balanced offensive attack. The Sahara's Jake Goldstein managed to get one past the Muffin Men netminder, but the game largely belonged to the Muffin Men.

The week's most intriguing matchup was the 8:00 PM clash at St. Mikes, where '4 Lines' battled the 'Flat-Earthers' to a hard-fought 4-4 tie. Jamie Poole's two goals, complemented by Shane Ferguson's three points (1G, 2A) and Ethan Lowe's two assists, kept '4 Lines' neck-and-neck with the Flat-Earthers, who saw Anthony Pennino score twice and Ryan Lee contribute a goal and three assists. This single point was enough to elevate '4 Lines' into a tie for second place.

To cap off their impressive week, '4 Lines' also secured a 4-2 win against the newly-listed 'Pdiym' in a rare Thursday evening game at the Mattamy Athletic Centre. Thomas Bevilacqua added to the goal tally, while Cam Scott netted both markers for Pdiym. Referee Sonny Martinello maintained a tight ship, calling only one minor penalty for slashing to '4 Lines' Ryan Fitzgerald, keeping the flow of play largely uninterrupted.
