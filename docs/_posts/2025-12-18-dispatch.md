**The Low B Dispatch: Monday/Wednesday Low B Recap**

# Top Dogs Cement Their Claims, While Mid-Pack Scrambles

Another week in the DMHL Monday/Wednesday Low B division brought its usual mix of dominant performances, surprising turns, and a classic St. Mike's stalemate. As the calendar flips to December 18th, the standings at the top remain relatively firm, but the chase for playoff positioning is heating up in the middle of the pack. Let’s dive into the week's action, from high-octane offences to ref-testing moments.

Monday night at Upper Canada College, **Don Cherry's** reminded everyone why they sit atop the league, handing **The Shockers** a decisive 6-1 defeat. Ryan Willms led the charge with a pair of goals and assists, while Koch Tsatsos dished out four helpers, turning passes into prime scoring opportunities with an artist's touch. The Shockers, despite a goal from Maxime Gagnon, struggled to find their rhythm, compounded by four minor penalties for hooking and cross-checking, hindering any offensive momentum.

Meanwhile, a double-header at St. Mikes Arena saw some compelling contests. In the early game, the **Muffin Men** served up a clinical 5-1 victory over **The Sahara**. Owen Burry and Cosimo Morin each potted two goals, demonstrating a knack for finding soft ice and finishing decisively. The Sahara's lone goal came from Jake Goldstein. The game featured a brief moment of 'spirited discussion' resulting in roughing minors for Burry and Nolan Klumak, suggesting a mutual understanding of physical play.

The later St. Mikes affair delivered a tight 4-4 draw between **4 Lines** and the **Flat-Earthers**. Jamie Poole's two goals and Shane Ferguson's three-point (1G, 2A) effort kept 4 Lines competitive. However, the Flat-Earthers, buoyed by Anthony Pennino's two goals and Ryan Lee's three assists, clawed back, with Pennino's late power-play marker leveling the score. This game was a penalty magnet, with five minors doled out by referees John Hall and Shane Bowler, maintaining a lively pace but perhaps disrupting flow.

Finally, in a rescheduled Thursday game at Mattamy Athletic Centre, **4 Lines** secured a 4-2 win over the fledgling **Pdiym**. While 4 Lines relied on solid team play and contributions from Thomas Bevilacqua, it was Pdiym's Cam Scott who turned heads, scoring both of his team's goals in his first recorded game. A solitary slashing penalty against 4 Lines' Ryan Fitzgerald kept the officials' notebooks relatively thin in this one. The Arctic Dolphins, still on a single tie for the season, will look to inject themselves into the narrative in coming weeks.

## The Low B Three Stars of the Week

**1st Star: Ryan Willms (Don Cherry's)** – Two goals and two assists in a dominant 6-1 victory. Willms was a one-man wrecking crew, making it look effortless.

**2nd Star: Jack Spears (Don Cherry's)** – A goal and an assist from the back end, while his team only conceded once. Spears demonstrated strong two-way play with a hint of physical edge, evidenced by his cross-checking minor.

**3rd Star: Owen Burry (Muffin Men)** – Burry delivered two crucial goals in the Muffin Men’s 5-1 win over The Sahara, proving his offensive worth. His roughing minor indicates he's not afraid to get his nose dirty when the situation calls for it.
