## Low B Rollercoaster: Sahara Shocks, Cherry's Hold Court

The Monday/Wednesday Low B division witnessed a seismic shift and steadfast dominance this week. The biggest story? The Sahara (6th, 15 pts) delivered a stunning 6-4 upset against 4 Lines (3rd, 18 pts), pulling them level in points with The Shockers. While 4 Lines still holds a superior goal differential, this win injected much-needed life into The Sahara's campaign, demonstrating their potential to disrupt the mid-table.

Monday's 8:00 PM tilt at St. Mikes Arena saw The Sahara mount a comeback against 4 Lines. Sam Goldstein (2G, 1A) spearheaded the offense, with Derrick Wong (1G, 2A) adding a crucial power-play goal. The game was a test for officials Carlos Verde and Mike Bonke, as 4 Lines' Elliott Sharp earned a double minor for Head Contact early. Not to be outdone, 4 Lines fought back with shorthanded goals from Ryan Fitzgerald (1G, 1A) and Luke Gravett.

Don Cherry's (1st, 29 pts) solidified their top spot, overcoming the Flat-Earthers (2nd, 20 pts) 4-2 in a tight 10:30 PM Tuesday battle at UCC School Arena. Sean Murphy (2G, 1A) was the architect, netting a pivotal shorthanded goal in the third period, with Michael Murphy (2A) providing offensive support.

Rounding out the week, The Shockers (5th, 15 pts) delivered a decisive 6-1 victory over the Muffin Men (4th, 16 pts) at St. Mikes Arena on Wednesday at 9:00 PM. Caden Bower (1G, 1A), Nick Chong (1G, 1A), and Josh Pope (2A) led a balanced attack, showcasing a robust team performance that could see them climb the standings.
