The Low B Dispatch

# Monday/Wednesday Low B: Top Teams Hold, Sahara Sizzles

## Week in Review: Dec 1-3, 2025

Another week of DMHL Low B action has passed, and while the top of the standings remains largely undisturbed, the mid-pack is seeing some intriguing shifts. Don Cherry's solidified their pole position with a victory, while The Sahara made a significant move up the ladder.

Monday night at St. Mike's saw **The Sahara** put on an offensive clinic against **4 Lines**, skating to a 6-4 win. The Sahara started strong with Isaac Jeffers and Sam Goldstein finding the net early. Despite 4 Lines' Elliott Sharp incurring a double-minor for head contact, they managed a shorthanded response from Ryan Fitzgerald at the buzzer of the first. 4 Lines battled back in the third, but Derrick Wong's power-play goal and a clutch empty-netter from Mitchell Moloney sealed The Sahara's win. The six penalties called in the game did impact the flow, but ultimately, The Sahara's 24.1% season PP% proved decisive.

Tuesday at UCC, **Don Cherry's** continued their dominant run, besting the **Flat-Earthers** 4-2. Sean Murphy notched two goals, including a short-handed effort in the third, showcasing why Don Cherry's boasts a league-leading 0.75 win percentage. Despite Flat-Earthers' Ryan Lee and Reid Chessell keeping it close through two periods, Don Cherry's disciplined play (two minor penalties) and timely scoring proved too much.

Wednesday's late game at St. Mike's had **The Shockers** delivering a resounding 6-1 defeat to the **Muffin Men**. Caden Bower (1G, 1A) and Nick Chong (1G, 1A) led the charge, with Marcus Gwyn-Neumann and Patrick Mcmullan also contributing. The Muffin Men's lone tally came from Charles Levy in the third, far too little, too late. The Shockers' defensive effort was stellar, limiting the league's second-highest scorer, Charles Levy, to a single point.
