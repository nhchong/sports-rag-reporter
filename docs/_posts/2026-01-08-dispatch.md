## Monday/Wednesday Low B: Don Cherry's Dominance and Tight Battles Define the Week

Another week of DMHL action at St. Mikes Arena brought expected dominance, a nail-biting finish, and a spirited tie. Don Cherry's continued their reign atop the standings, while 4 Lines solidified their position, and the Flat-Earthers and The Sahara scrapped for a point.

Don Cherry's, still leading the pack with a formidable 29 points, utterly steamrolled the Muffin Men in an 8-1 Wednesday night affair.
> Don Cherry's: GFA 4.47, PP% 23.1%.
Their offensive firepower, particularly from **Ryan Willms** (3G, 2A) and **Sean Murphy** (1G, 2A), was simply overwhelming, proving why their league-best goal differential of +33 is no fluke. The Muffin Men, now with a -7 differential, struggled to find answers against the league leaders, their lone goal coming on the power play from Ryan Irwin.

Monday night saw a much tighter contest as 4 Lines edged out The Shockers 6-5. **Luke Gravett** was the catalyst for 4 Lines, potting a hat-trick and adding two assists, including a shorthanded goal in the second period, keeping the Shockers at bay.

The Shockers' **Maxime Gagnon** (2G) and **Josh Pope** (1G, 2A) mounted a strong comeback effort, making it a dramatic finish. Referees Mike Bonke and Shane Bowler managed a game that saw a few penalties but nothing that dictated the final outcome.

Wednesday's late 9:00 PM game was a back-and-forth slugfest ending in a 5-5 tie between the Flat-Earthers and The Sahara. The Sahara, down early after three first-period goals from the Flat-Earthers including markers from **Ethan Hirst**, **Reid Chessell**, and **Marcus Simmonds**, clawed their way back. **Wes Martin** led The Sahara with two crucial goals, while **Yanir Levy** added a goal and an assist. The officiating duo of Darcy McNamee and Sonny Martinello had their hands full, calling eight penalties in total across both sides, making it a physical contest to cap off the week.

### The Low B Three Stars of the Week:

*   **1st Star: Luke Gravett (4 Lines)** — His 3 goals and 2 assists, including a shorthanded effort, were instrumental in a crucial 6-5 victory.
*   **2nd Star: Ryan Willms (Don Cherry's)** — A dominant 3-goal, 2-assist performance contributing to an 8-1 rout.
*   **3rd Star: Anthony Pennino (Flat-Earthers)** — Scored a goal and contributed to the physical play, drawing a cross-checking minor in his team's 5-5 tie.
