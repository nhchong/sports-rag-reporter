# January's Jolt: Goals, Grime, and Grinders at St. Mikes

## Standings Shift: Top Dogs Thrive, Mid-Table Scramble Heats Up

The DMHL's Monday/Wednesday Low B division opened January with a bang: dominant wins, narrow escapes, and an active penalty box. Don Cherry's solidified their top spot, while the middle-of-the-pack battle tightened considerably.

Monday at St. Mikes, **4 Lines** edged **The Shockers** 6-5. Maxime Gagnon (2G, 1A) and Ari Levine (1G, 1A) led The Shockers, but Luke Gravett’s (2G, 2A), including a pivotal shorthanded goal for 4 Lines, proved the difference. Five penalties were assessed, notably a four-minute cross-check.

Wednesday's doubleheader saw **Don Cherry's** dismantle the **Muffin Men** 8-1. Ryan Willms (3G, 2A) delivered a clinic, while Cassady Louks (2G), including a shorthanded marker, contributed heavily. Ryan Irwin secured the Muffin Men’s lone power-play goal. A clean game overall with minimal penalty interference.

The night concluded with a chaotic 5-5 tie between **The Sahara** and **Flat-Earthers**. Wes Martin (2G) and Wil Nenadovic (PPG) paced The Sahara. The Flat-Earthers featured five different scorers, including Anthony Pennino. Referees McNamee and Martinello called eight penalties, four in the third, visibly impacting the back-and-forth contest.

Don Cherry's now holds 27 points, with 4 Lines (18 pts) closing on the Flat-Earthers (19 pts). The Sahara (14 pts) also gained a crucial point.
