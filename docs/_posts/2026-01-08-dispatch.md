## The Week That Was: Stability at the Top, Scramble in the Middle

Amidst brisk January nights at St. Mikes Arena, the DMHL's Monday/Wednesday Low B division delivered its usual blend of grit and goals. The week's action notably solidified Don Cherry's hold on the top spot.

Don Cherry's extended their reign, making short work of the Muffin Men in an 8-1 rout on Wednesday. Ryan Willms potted a hat-trick and two assists, showcasing Cherry's league-best goal differential. The Muffin Men's lone tally, a power play goal from Ryan Irwin, offered little solace in an outing solidifying their lower-tier status.

Monday delivered a tight 6-5 win for 4 Lines over The Shockers. Luke Gravett led the charge for 4 Lines with two goals and two assists, including a crucial shorthanded marker. The Shockers, despite two goals from Maxime Gagnon and a spirited effort, couldn't close the gap. 4 Lines solidify third, while The Shockers hover precariously near the bottom.

Wednesday's late 5-5 tie between Flat-Earthers and The Sahara proved a physical affair. Eight penalties were doled out by referees Darcy McNamee and Sonny Martinello, keeping the penalty boxes busy. The Sahara, led by Wes Martin's two goals and an assist, clawed back to force the tie against a Flat-Earthers squad that saw five different goal-scorers, including Anthony Pennino and Reid Chessell.

## Three Stars of the Week

### 1st Star: Ryan Willms, Don Cherry's
> 3 Goals, 2 Assists in a dominant 8-1 victory. Willms' clinical finishing drove his team's offense.

### 3rd Star: Wes Martin, The Sahara
