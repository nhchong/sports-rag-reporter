**The Low B Dispatch: Monday/Wednesday Low B Report**

### Week in Review: Shockers Climb, Cherry's Gets a Gift

The Monday/Wednesday Low B division saw some movement this week, with The Shockers making a tangible push up the standings. After their dominant performance, they've leapfrogged The Sahara into sixth place, now holding 15 points to The Sahara's 14. Don Cherry's maintains their lead, adding two points from a surprising turn of events.

Monday kicked off with an unexpected forfeiture from 4 Lines, handing Don Cherry's a 1-0 victory at St. Mikes Arena. Not the most thrilling way to earn points, but they all count. Later that evening, at the Upper Canada College School Arena, The Shockers delivered a decisive 5-0 shutout against The Sahara. Caden Bower led the charge with a goal and two assists, while Nick Chong chipped in with two helpers, demonstrating strong offensive chemistry that perfectly complemented their stifling defence. The officials were kept busy with five penalties called, but The Shockers even managed a shorthanded goal from Gabe Fischer-Schmidt, showcasing their disciplined aggression.

Wednesday night, the Flat-Earthers edged out the Muffin Men 4-2 at St. Mikes. Charles Levy was a bright spot for the Muffin Men, burying two goals, but it wasn't enough to overcome a balanced Flat-Earthers attack. Reid Chessell, Anthony Pennino, Daniel Solomos, and Ethan Hirst each found the back of the net, ensuring the Flat-Earthers solidified their second-place position. Only one tripping minor was assessed all game, ensuring a free-flowing contest.
