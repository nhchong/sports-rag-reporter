## The Grind

The Downtown Men's Hockey League's Monday/Wednesday Low B division saw some significant shifts this past week, even if not all were earned on the ice. Don Cherry's solidified their top spot, not with a highlight-reel goal, but an "Official Forfeit" victory over 4 Lines on Monday night at St. Mikes. While a win is a win, it certainly leaves fans wanting more puck drops.

Speaking of more action, The Shockers delivered a dominant performance, shutting out The Sahara 5-0 at Upper Canada College School Arena. The late 10:30 PM start on a chilly Monday, typical of Toronto in late January, didn't dampen their spirits.

> "The Shockers scored five unanswered goals, with #3 Caden Bower contributing a goal and two assists, including a helper on the short-handed tally by #18 Gabe Fischer-Schmidt."

This commanding win propels The Shockers into a tie with The Sahara in points (15), nudging them ahead with a superior win count.

Wednesday night, Flat-Earthers edged out the Muffin Men 4-2 at St. Mikes. It was a tight battle, with Flat-Earthers' #5 Reid Chessell opening the scoring. Muffin Men's #10 Charles Levy kept his team in it, potting both of their goals, showcasing a relentless effort even in defeat. The officiating was light for this contest, with only one minor penalty called against Muffin Men's Ryan Irwin. In contrast, the Shockers-Sahara game saw a combined five minors, indicating a more physical affair overseen by referees Mark Donohoe and Eric Beltrami.

## Three Stars of the Week

*   **1st Star: Caden Bower (The Shockers)** – A goal and two assists (3 points) in The Shockers' 5-0 triumph, including a primary assist on the game's opening goal and a helper on the shorthanded marker. A truly impactful performance.
*   **2nd Star: Maxime Gagnon (The Shockers)** – Also recorded a goal and two assists (3 points), rounding out The Shockers’ scoring in their decisive shutout victory.
*   **3rd Star: Charles Levy (Muffin Men)** – Notched both goals for the Muffin Men against the Flat-Earthers. Despite the loss, Levy's individual offensive output was commendable.
