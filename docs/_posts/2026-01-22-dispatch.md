## Forfeit Frenzies and Shutouts: M/W Low B Week in Review

Another week in the DMHL Monday/Wednesday Low B division saw Don Cherry's solidify their top spot, albeit unconventionally, while The Shockers made a decisive move.

Don Cherry's claimed an official forfeit victory over 4 Lines on Monday at St. Mikes Arena, boosting their league-leading points tally to 29. While a win is a win, it's certainly not the ideal way to spend a 10 PM slot.

The Shockers, however, put in the work. They delivered a commanding 5-0 shutout against The Sahara at Upper Canada College School Arena, also a late 10:30 PM start.
> The Shockers' Caden Bower contributed a goal and an assist, while Nick Chong, with two assists, played a characteristically robust game, earning an Interference penalty in the 3rd period. Gabe Fischer-Schmidt added a shorthanded marker in the 2nd.

Wednesday night, the Flat-Earthers edged out the Muffin Men 4-2 at St. Mikes. Charles Levy's two goals for the Muffin Men kept it close, but contributions from Anthony Pennino and Ethan Hirst (a goal and an assist each) sealed the win for the Flat-Earthers. This game saw remarkably little whistle, with only one minor penalty called by Referees Evan Benwell and Brad Kuchar. In contrast, the Shockers-Sahara tilt featured five penalties, primarily against The Shockers, indicating a more physical, albeit perhaps less disciplined, affair.

**Three Stars of the Week:**

*   **1st Star: Charles Levy (Muffin Men)**
    > Levy netted both goals for the Muffin Men in their battle against the Flat-Earthers. A two-goal effort, even in a loss, is MVP-worthy.
*   **2nd Star: The Shockers Goaltending & Defensive Unit**
    > A 5-0 shutout against The Sahara speaks volumes. While no single netminder is named, the collective effort was undeniable.
*   **3rd Star: Nick Chong (The Shockers)**
    > With two assists and an interference call, Chong embodies the productive agitator, contributing offensively while playing with an edge.
