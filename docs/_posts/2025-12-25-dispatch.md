## Monday/Wednesday Low B: Sahara Sands the Cherries, Flat-Earthers Hold Ground

This week saw a seismic shift at the top of the Monday/Wednesday Low B standings, not in rank, but in perception. The undisputed **Don Cherry's**, sitting comfortably at 1st with a league-best +33 goal differential, were utterly dominated by **The Sahara**, falling 6-0. This result, played out late at 10:30 PM at the UCC School Arena, pushes The Sahara up to 4th (17 points), leapfrogging the Muffin Men and The Shockers, and injects much-needed parity into the top half.

> "The Sahara's 6-0 victory over Don Cherry's was a statement, demonstrating a defensive fortitude (0 GA) and offensive burst (6 GF) that belied their prior ranking."

**The Sahara** were relentless, with **Wes Martin** leading the charge, bagging a hat trick and an assist. Not far behind, **Kosta Likourezos** tallied a goal and two assists, showcasing a balanced attack that Don Cherry's simply couldn't answer. Notably, referees Mark Donohoe and John Hall kept their whistles silent, calling zero penalties in a surprisingly clean, yet lopsided affair.

Meanwhile, a more tightly contested battle unfolded at the Mattamy Athletic Centre at 10:00 PM as **Flat-Earthers** edged out **The Shockers** 3-2. This game, officiated by Sonny Martinello and Brad Kuchar, saw a flurry of penalties, particularly against the Flat-Earthers who accumulated five minors. Despite the penalty trouble, goals from **Ryan Lee**, **Reid Chessell**, and a timely power-play 'Spare' goal in the third period secured the win for the Flat-Earthers, who remain 2nd with 22 points. The Shockers' **Nick Chong** was a playmaker with two assists, but it wasn't enough.

Earlier at 9:00 PM, also at Mattamy, **4 Lines** edged the **Muffin Men** in a high-scoring 6-5 thriller. **Ryan Fitzgerald** (2G, 1A) and **Ellis Gerussi-Turner** (1G, 1A) were key for 4 Lines, pushing them to 3rd place with 20 points. For the Muffin Men, **Charles Levy** countered with two goals and an assist, but their efforts fell just short, keeping them at 5th. In a stark contrast to their later game, referees Kuchar and Martinello also oversaw this game without a single penalty call.

### The Three Stars of the Week:

*   **1st Star: Wes Martin (The Sahara)** – A dominant hat trick and an assist in the stunning 6-0 shutout over league-leaders Don Cherry's.
*   **2nd Star: Kosta Likourezos (The Sahara)** – One goal and two assists, anchoring The Sahara's surprising defensive masterclass and offensive explosion.
*   **3rd Star: Anthony Pennino (Flat-Earthers)** – While not a scoring leader this week, Pennino registered an assist and collected two minor penalties, embodying the 'productive agitator' in a gritty win.
