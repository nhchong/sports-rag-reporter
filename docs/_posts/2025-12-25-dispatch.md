## The Week That Was: A December Chill and Shifting Sands

Monday, December 22nd, brought a palpable chill to Toronto's rinks, echoing some unexpected shifts in the Monday/Wednesday Low B standings. The Mattamy Athletic Centre saw some tight contests, but the biggest story unfolded later at the Upper Canada College School Arena, where The Sahara delivered a shockwave.

The Sahara, previously lurking at Rank 6, delivered a stunning 6-0 shutout against the league-leading Don Cherry's. This wasn't just a win; it was a statement.
> The Sahara's #14 Wes Martin potted a hat-trick, with goals spread across all three periods, setting the tone for their dominant performance. Their first goal came just 1:10 into the first period.
This decisive victory vaulted The Sahara into a tie for 5th place with The Shockers, drastically improving their goal differential. Don Cherry's, meanwhile, will be keen to erase this memory. The officiating crew of Mark Donohoe and John Hall kept the game flowing smoothly, with zero penalties called.

Earlier, at the Mattamy Athletic Centre, the Flat-Earthers edged out The Shockers 3-2 in a game riddled with penalties.
> The Flat-Earthers were whistled for five minors, including two on #2 Anthony Pennino, while The Shockers had one.
Despite the parade to the box, Flat-Earthers secured two points, with #5 Reid Chessell notching a goal and an assist. The Shockers' #44 Nick Chong contributed two assists, but it wasn't enough.

The Muffin Men and 4 Lines also clashed at Mattamy, with 4 Lines emerging victorious 6-5 in another closely contested match.
> #10 Charles Levy of the Muffin Men put up 2 goals and an assist, showcasing his offensive prowess.
However, 4 Lines' balanced attack, led by #24 Ryan Fitzgerald's 2 goals and an assist, secured them the win and solidified their hold on third place. #17 Adam Miller also chipped in with three assists for 4 Lines.
