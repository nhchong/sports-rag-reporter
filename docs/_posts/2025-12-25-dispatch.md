**The Low B Dispatch: Monday/Wednesday Division**

## Shaking Up the Standings: The Sahara's Surge and a Scrappy Week on the Ice
### Late-Night Skirmishes and Strategic Wins Redefine the Playoff Picture

Another week of Downtown Men's Hockey League action saw some significant movement in the Monday/Wednesday Low B standings, especially as the calendar nudges closer to the new year. Late-night starts across the city, from Mattamy to UCC, didn't dampen the competitive spirit, though some teams found more luck than others.

Monday's slate kicked off with **The Sahara** delivering a stunning 6-0 shutout against top-ranked **Don Cherry's** at UCC. This wasn't just a win; it was a statement. Forward Wes Martin was an offensive dynamo, bagging a hat trick (3G, 0A), while Kosta Likourezos chipped in with a goal and two assists (1G, 2A). Don Cherry's, typically a scoring juggernaut with a 4.22 GFA, was completely stifled in a remarkably penalty-free contest overseen by Referees Donohoe and Hall. The Sahara’s dominant performance vaults them up the table.

Over at Mattamy Athletic Centre, the **Flat-Earthers** edged out **The Shockers** 3-2 in a game that saw the referees, Martinello and Kuchar, earn their stripes with six minor penalties called. Flat-Earthers' Anthony Pennino picked up four PIMs (hooking, cross-checking) alongside an assist, embodying the 'productive agitator' role. Their power-play marker, a spare goal assisted by Stephen Kim, proved critical. The Shockers, despite a Nick Chong-assisted power-play goal, couldn't close the gap.

In the night's other high-scoring affair, **4 Lines** narrowly defeated the **Muffin Men** 6-5. This evenly matched tilt, also penalty-free under Martinello and Kuchar, saw Muffin Men's Charles Levy notch two goals in a losing effort. But it was Ryan Fitzgerald's two goals and Adam Miller's three assists that powered 4 Lines to victory, allowing them to leapfrog the Muffin Men in the standings.

**Three Stars of the Week:**

⭐ **1st Star: Wes Martin (The Sahara)** – A hat trick (3G) against the division leaders in a decisive shutout victory. Pure impact.

⭐ ⭐ **2nd Star: Kosta Likourezos (The Sahara)** – With 1 goal and 2 assists (3 Pts), Likourezos was instrumental in The Sahara's offensive explosion and their impressive shutout win.

⭐ ⭐ ⭐ **3rd Star: Anthony Pennino (Flat-Earthers)** – A gritty performance with an assist and 4 penalty minutes (two minors), Pennino contributed to his team's tight victory with both skill and tenacious play.
