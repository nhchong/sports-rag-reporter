The Curtain Falls (Quietly) on Regular Season, Playoff Brackets Set
The DMHL Monday/Wednesday Low B division wraps up with a whimper, not a bang, as teams brace for a best-of-2 playoff battle.

## Final Standings Set: Cherry's Reign Supreme, Playoff Picture Clear
Well, folks, that's a wrap on the regular season. Not with a bang, but with the quiet formality of an official forfeiture. **Don Cherry's** finishes atop the division, a testament to their consistent play all season. Their 12 wins, 6 ties, and a league-leading +33 goal differential clearly separate them from the pack. They'll enter the playoffs as the formidable #1 seed.

The biggest story this week, if one can call it that, was the single scheduled match between **4 Lines** and the **Flat-Earthers** on Monday, February 16th, at the Mattamy Athletic Centre. A late 11:00 PM start time might have been a factor, but ultimately, the game was declared an Official Forfeit.

> "GameID: 1196067, EventType: Official, Description: Status: Official Forfeit"

This means no goals, no assists, and frankly, no sweat for anyone involved. Given the cold reality of a Toronto February evening (even indoors), perhaps a mutual agreement was reached for an early night. This non-event locks in the final playoff matchups:

*   **Don Cherry's (#1)** will face the **Muffin Men (#6)**.
*   **Flat-Earthers (#2)** take on **The Shockers (#5)**.
*   **4 Lines (#3)** are set to battle **The Sahara (#4)**.

## Weekly Data Insights: A Quiet Week on the Stat Sheet
With the week's sole "game" being a forfeit, there are, unsurprisingly, no on-ice performances to dissect from this final regular season round. We look ahead to the playoffs, where the real stories will be written.

However, a glance at the season-long individual leaders reminds us of the offensive firepower we've seen: **Michael Murphy** of Don Cherry's leads the league with 31 points, closely followed by **Charles Levy** (Muffin Men) and **Sean Murphy** (Don Cherry's), both with 27 points. These are the players who will need to be shut down for any team hoping to advance.

## The Officials' Call: A Night Off for the Whistles
For the 4 Lines vs. Flat-Earthers match, the official assignment was simply "Status: Official Forfeit." No penalties, no disputed calls, just a blank slate. Perhaps the officials enjoyed a rare Monday evening away from the rink.

## Playoff Preview: The Real Season Begins
While this week's conclusion was rather anticlimactic, the slate is now clean, and the stakes are real. The playoffs, a best-of-2 series, commence on February 25th. Every shift, every shot, and every save will matter from here on out. Don Cherry's are the clear front-runners, but as we all know, the Low B playoffs have a way of humbling even the most dominant regular-season teams.

## THE THREE STARS OF THE WEEK

Given the singular event this week was a forfeit, preventing any on-ice performances from being recorded or evaluated, we must regrettably announce:

**No Three Stars Awarded This Week.**

However, we extend an honorable mention to all teams for a spirited regular season and wish everyone the best of luck as we head into the crucible of the playoffs.
