**The Low B Dispatch: Monday/Wednesday Low B**

# Navigating the Late-Season Logjam: Don Cherry's Dominates, Mid-Pack Scrambles

Another week in the DMHL Monday/Wednesday Low B division, and while Don Cherry's continues to pull away at the top, the fight for playoff positioning behind them is tightening into a genuine dogfight. This past week saw a mix of blowouts and nail-biting finishes, with the schedule even throwing a curveball or two.

On Monday night, **Don Cherry's** put on a clinic at UCC, dismantling **The Shockers** 6-1. Ryan Willms (2G, 2A) and Koch Tsatsos (1G, 3A) led the offensive charge, showcasing why Don Cherry's holds the top spot. The Shockers, meanwhile, spent a bit too much time in the box, logging four minor penalties, a trend they’ll want to curb. Elsewhere, the **Muffin Men** proved too much for **The Sahara** at St. Mikes, securing a decisive 5-1 victory. Owen Burry and Cosimo Morin each bagged two goals, with Owen Lownie adding a goal and an assist. The Sahara's Jake Goldstein chipped in their lone marker, but the team's struggles persist.

The most compelling clash of the week unfolded at St. Mikes between **4 Lines** and the **Flat-Earthers**, ending in a 4-4 stalemate. Jamie Poole (2G, 1A) and Shane Ferguson (1G, 2A) were instrumental for 4 Lines, while Ryan Lee (1G, 3A) and Anthony Pennino (2G, 1A) paced the Flat-Earthers. This game saw a parade to the penalty box, with both sides contributing to a significant officiating workload by John Hall and Shane Bowler. Pennino's power-play equalizer with under a minute left underscores the fine margins in this league. Finally, in an unusual Thursday night fixture at the Mattamy Athletic Centre, **4 Lines** notched a 4-2 win against the newly-arrived **Pdiym**. Despite relying on a pair of spares for three goals, 4 Lines got a critical two points. Pdiym's Cam Scott notched both of his team's goals (adding an assist), an impressive debut performance despite the loss. This point gained pushes the Flat-Earthers to 2nd with 19 points, while 4 Lines sits just behind in 3rd with 18, keeping the race for prime seeding intensely competitive.
