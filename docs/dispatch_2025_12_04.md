The Low B Dispatch - Monday/Wednesday Low B Recap

## Don Cherry's Hold Court, Sahara Heats Up as Playoff Race Tightens

The DMHL Monday/Wednesday Low B division saw the top seed solidify its position while the middle of the pack continued its spirited scrap for playoff footing. Games across St. Mikes Arena and UCC School Arena delivered a mix of dominant performances and tight, penalty-laden affairs.

Wednesday evening at St. Mikes, **The Shockers** delivered a resounding 6-1 defeat to the **Muffin Men**. While Muffin Men’s league-leading scorer Charles Levy managed a lone goal, The Shockers’ offense was relentless. Caden Bower (1G, 1A) and Nick Chong (1G, 1A) led a balanced attack, supported by two assists from Josh Pope. The officiating was light with only three minor penalties called, allowing the game's flow to remain largely uninterrupted by whistles.

Tuesday at UCC saw the league's top two clash as **Don Cherry's** bested the **Flat-Earthers** 4-2. Don Cherry's asserted their dominance, driven by Sean Murphy's two goals, including a crucial shorthanded tally in the third period. Michael Murphy and Ryan Willms each added two points, showcasing the depth of the top-ranked squad. The officials kept this high-stakes contest remarkably clean, with only three minor penalties called in total, indicating disciplined play from both sides.

Monday's battle at St. Mikes witnessed **The Sahara** claw their way to a vital 6-4 victory over **4 Lines**. The Sahara's balanced offensive display saw Sam Goldstein (2G, 1A) and Derrick Wong (1G, 2A) light the lamp. This game, however, was a penalty fest with seven minors dished out, including a four-minute head contact call against 4 Lines’ Elliott Sharp in the first period. The Sahara capitalized on their power play opportunities, while 4 Lines managed two shorthanded goals of their own, suggesting penalties heavily influenced the game's dynamic rather than just volume.
