**The Low B Dispatch: Monday/Wednesday Low B Recap**

# Mid-Table Mayhem: Sahara Shakes Up Standings, Earthers Edge Shockers

What a Monday night in the DMHL Low B division, folks. While Don Cherry's still holds the top spot, the gap feels a little less insurmountable after a week of unexpected results and spirited contests. The mid-table is a genuine scramble, and if this week's action is any indication, we’re in for a captivating stretch run.

The biggest story? **The Sahara** pulled off a stunning 6-0 shutout against division leaders **Don Cherry's** at Upper Canada College, an arena known for its late-night, low-scoring affairs. Six unanswered goals against a team with a league-leading +26 goal differential isn't just a win; it's a statement. Wes Martin led the charge with a hat trick, supported by a three-point night from Kosta Likourezos and goals from Ian Istvan and Yanir Levy. The officiating crew of Mark Donohoe and John Hall had a quiet night, with zero penalties called, letting the players decide this one entirely on skill.

Over at the Mattamy Athletic Centre, the **Flat-Earthers** narrowly escaped with a 3-2 victory over **The Shockers** in a game heavily influenced by the whistle. Sonny Martinello and Brad Kuchar were kept busy, with the Flat-Earthers racking up five minor penalties to The Shockers' one. Despite the frequent trips to the box, Ryan Lee, Reid Chessell, and a spare player managed to find the net for the Flat-Earthers, with their power play capitalizing when it mattered. The Shockers’ Marcus Gwyn-Neumann and a spare kept it close, even notching a power-play goal of their own.

Earlier in the evening, also at Mattamy, **4 Lines** outlasted the **Muffin Men** in a back-and-forth 6-5 thriller. This was another penalty-free affair. Ryan Fitzgerald netted two goals for 4 Lines, while Austin Weiler, Thomas Mchugh, Ellis Gerussi-Turner, and another spare contributed to their impressive offensive output. Charles Levy matched Fitzgerald with two goals for the Muffin Men, but it wasn't enough to secure the win for his squad, who despite scoring 5 goals, drop another two points.

## The Three Stars of the Week

*   **1st Star: Wes Martin (The Sahara)** - A commanding hat trick in a 6-0 upset victory over the league leaders. Unquestionably the MVP of the week.
*   **2nd Star: Kosta Likourezos (The Sahara)** - One goal and two assists, providing pivotal secondary scoring that fueled The Sahara's unexpected dominant performance.
*   **3rd Star: Anthony Pennino (Flat-Earthers)** - An assist in a tight 3-2 win, coupled with a pair of minor penalties (hooking, cross-checking). A classic productive agitator performance.
