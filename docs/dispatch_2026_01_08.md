# The Wednesday Night Debacle: Or, How Don Cherry's Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Goal Differential

Alright, folks, settle in. We've just navigated another week of the Low B League, and if you thought the holiday hangover was bad, some teams clearly brought it onto the ice. We saw a goalfest, a massacre, and a tie that felt less like a draw and more like mutual exhaustion. Let's dig into the digital tape and see what really went down.

## Monday Night Melee: 4 Lines 6 - 5 The Shockers

Monday night kicked things off with **4 Lines** edging out **The Shockers** in a 6-5 thriller at St. Mikes Arena. This game felt less like structured hockey and more like a playground free-for-all, which, let's be honest, is peak Low B.

**4 Lines** forward **Luke Gravett** was a one-man wrecking crew, racking up two goals and two assists, including a shorthanded beauty in the second period that felt like a punch to the gut for The Shockers. His 16 points on the season now look a bit more polished. **Thomas Bevilacqua**, playing the role of silent assassin, chipped in three assists, quietly boosting his season total to 9 points from 11 games. Over on The Shockers' bench, **Maxime Gagnon** tried to drag his team back into it with a pair of goals, moving him to 11 points on the season. **Josh Pope** and **Caden Bower** each added two assists, proving there's still some offensive spark in that locker room.

But here's the kicker: **Austin Weiler** of 4 Lines decided a double minor for cross-checking in the second period was the appropriate response to the game's flow, costing his team 4 minutes of ice time. **Ethan Lowe** also contributed 2 minutes for hooking in the third, bringing 4 Lines' total PIM for the game to 6. The Shockers' **Caden Bower** (Tripping, 2 mins) and **Keelan Hughes** (High-Sticking, 2 mins) also took minors, for a total of 4 PIM. The referees, Mike Bonke and Shane Bowler, had their work cut out for them, clearly earning their officiating stripes as tempers flared in this tight contest.

## Wednesday Night Massacre: Don Cherry's 8 - 1 Muffin Men

Wednesday night, and if you had 'Don Cherry's to utterly dismantle the Muffin Men' on your bingo card, congratulations, you're either psychic or just follow the standings. **Don Cherry's** handed the **Muffin Men** an 8-1 shellacking.

**Ryan Willms** decided to make the highlight reel his personal property, potting a hat-trick and two assists, directly contributing to five of Don Cherry's eight goals. His season point total now sits at an impressive 19 in just 11 games. **Sean Murphy** also had a stellar night with three assists, pushing his season assist tally to 14, good for third in the league. **Cassady Louks** chipped in with two goals, including a shorthanded tally in the third that just twisted the knife further.

The Muffin Men, bless their hearts, managed a single power-play marker from **Ryan Irwin** in the third period, his 5th goal of the season, saving them from the ignominy of a shutout. League-leading scorer **Charles Levy**, with 26 points, was conspicuously absent from the score sheet in this bloodbath – perhaps he was practicing social distancing from the puck. Don Cherry's demonstrated why they sit atop the league with a **0.765 Win Percentage** and a ridiculous **+30 goal differential**; their special teams even notched a power-play and a shorthanded goal in this contest. The Muffin Men, meanwhile, continue to struggle, dropping their record to 7-9-1.

Don Cherry's also collected 6 PIM, with **Daniel Swift** (Slashing, 2 mins), **Nik Tsatsos** (Roughing, 2 mins), and **Sam Pasich** (Hooking, 2 mins) all visiting the sin bin. The Muffin Men, true to their league-low 34 total PIM, kept it relatively clean with only 4 PIM (Owen Lownie for Tripping, Cole Singleton for Interference), but maybe a little more fire in the belly (and less in the penalty box) would have served them better.

## Wednesday Night Chaos: The Sahara 5 - 5 Flat-Earthers

Following the Cherry's romp, the nightcap featured **The Sahara** and the **Flat-Earthers** in a 5-5 tie. If you thought the first game had its moments of chaos, this one truly delivered on the 'Low B' promise of unregulated mayhem.

The Flat-Earthers came out hot in the first, with **Ethan Hirst**, **Reid Chessell**, **Marcus Simmonds**, and **Aaron Johnson** all finding the back of the net. They seemed to be trying to prove that the earth isn't the only thing that's flat – their opponents' chances of winning were too. Simmonds also added an assist to his goal, while Johnson added one to his as well.

But The Sahara, proving they can generate offense even in the driest conditions (pun intended), mounted a furious comeback. **Wes Martin** bagged two goals, and **Yanir Levy** added one, ensuring The Sahara clawed their way back to a point. Martin now has 13 points on the season.

This game also highlighted the Flat-Earthers' ongoing penalty issues; they currently boast the league's third-highest PIM count with **63**, a trend **Anthony Pennino**, with his league-leading **17 PIM**, and his cross-checking penalty this week, seems keen to maintain. Flat-Earthers accrued 8 PIM in total this game, with **Ryan Lee** (Slashing), **Mike Vanderlinden** (Body Contact), and **Kris Jansen** (Holding) joining Pennino in the box. The Sahara, not to be outdone in the PIM department, accumulated 8 minutes themselves, with **Mac Savage** (Tripping), **Derrick Wong** (High-Sticking), **Mitchell Moloney** (Hooking), and **Andrew Biggs** (Body Contact) all taking minor penalties. The officials, Darcy McNamee and Sonny Martinello, clearly earning their double-shift pay, along with Convenor Spencer Watt, must have needed a stiff drink after this one. Despite the tie, The Sahara's league-best **25.9% power play** and **91.7% penalty kill rates** continue to be surprisingly effective given their overall standing.

## League Overview & Trends: Penalties, Prowess, and Potential

Looking at the bigger picture, **Don Cherry's** continues its dominant march, sitting comfortably at the top with **26 points** and a win percentage of **0.765**. They’re a well-oiled machine, leading the league in goals for (**71**) and goal differential (**+30**).

After their win this week, **4 Lines** holds steady in second with **17 points**, just ahead of the **Flat-Earthers** who are also on 17 points, but with a less flattering goal differential of **-7**. The Flat-Earthers' league-low **9.5% power play** isn't doing them any favors either, especially when they're racking up the PIMs like they're going out of style.

Meanwhile, **The Sahara** may be fifth with **14 points**, but their **25.9% power play** is lethal, the best in the league, hinting at some untapped potential if they can stay out of their own way. For **The Shockers**, despite the loss, they maintain a positive goal differential of **+2**, which is somewhat baffling for a sixth-place team. They also remain the league's most penalized team with a total of **74 PIM**. Someone needs to remind them that this isn't the OHL; the scouts aren't watching for tough guys here. As for the **Muffin Men**, that 8-1 drubbing has to sting. With **Charles Levy's 26 points** leading the league, they need to figure out how to translate individual brilliance into team success.

So, there you have it. Another week of Low B hockey in the books. Don Cherry's flexing, 4 Lines holding their ground, and the middle of the pack duking it out with a mix of high-scoring affairs and penalty parades. Until next time, keep your heads up, sticks on the ice, and maybe, just maybe, try to stay out of the box.
