# Early January Jitters: Cherry's Dominate, Flat-Earthers Tie, 4 Lines Squeak By

The DMHL Monday/Wednesday Low B division kicked off January at St. Mikes Arena with a mixed bag of results. Don Cherry's cemented their top spot with a dominant win, while 4 Lines secured a crucial two points, and the Flat-Earthers earned a hard-fought draw.

Monday's opener saw **4 Lines** barely outlast **The Shockers** in a tight 6-5 affair. Luke Gravett led the charge for 4 Lines with two goals, including a critical shorthanded marker, and an assist. Adam Miller and Thomas Mchugh also contributed offensively to hold off a resilient Shockers squad, who saw Maxime Gagnon net two goals and Josh Pope add a goal and two assists. Officiating was notably active, with three penalties called on The Shockers and a double minor on 4 Lines' Austin Weiler for cross-checking, certainly impacting the flow.

Wednesday was a tale of two games. **Don Cherry's** made a statement, steamrolling the **Muffin Men** 8-1. Ryan Willms was unstoppable, potting a hat trick and adding two assists, while Cassady Louks chipped in with two goals. The Muffin Men's lone tally came from Ryan Irwin, a meager response to Don Cherry's offensive onslaught, which solidified their league-leading position.

Later that evening, **The Sahara** and the **Flat-Earthers** engaged in a wild 5-5 draw. Wes Martin paced The Sahara with two goals, and Yanir Levy added a goal and an assist. For the Flat-Earthers, Ethan Hirst, Marcus Simmonds, Reid Chessell, Aaron Johnson, and Anthony Pennino all found the back of the net in a spread-out attack. This contest was a penalty-filled affair, with four minors apiece, including a late cross-checking call on Pennino, underscoring the intensity of the battle for mid-table points. The tie moves Flat-Earthers marginally further from 4 Lines, while The Sahara claws a point closer to the playoff picture.

## This Week's Three Stars

1.  **Ryan Willms (Don Cherry's):** A masterful performance with 3 goals and 2 assists in a single game. Truly the engine of Don Cherry's dominant offense.
2.  **Ellis Gerussi-Turner (4 Lines):** A quiet but impactful two assists for a defenseman in a pivotal one-goal victory for 4 Lines.
3.  **Anthony Pennino (Flat-Earthers):** Scored a key goal in a high-stakes tie and, with 17 PIM on the season (including a late penalty this week), epitomizes the productive agitator.
