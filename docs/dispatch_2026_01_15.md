# The Low B Dispatch: Week 17 Wrap-Up – Goals, Penalties, and Referees on Double Duty

Alright, gentlemen, settle in. Grab whatever lukewarm beverage passes for a reward after a Monday or Wednesday night, because we've got some ground to cover. Another week in the Low B, and while some things remain as constant as the smell of stale gear, others decided to throw a wrench in the works. The analytics are in, the whistle has blown, and frankly, the stat sheet doesn't lie. Let's peel back the layers of last week's ice battles.

## On-Ice Action: A Micro-Analysis of the Week's Skirmishes

We had three contests this week that demanded our attention, each a microcosm of the league's shifting sands.

### Game 1173867: The Sahara (5) vs. 4 Lines (4) – A Desert Oasis of Offense

This was a Wednesday night affair at St. Mikes that saw The Sahara, currently ranked 5th, edge out 4 Lines, sitting comfortably at 2nd, in a tight **5-4 victory**. For The Sahara, this was a crucial two points, pushing their overall record to 5-8-4 and nudging them closer to the middle of the pack. For 4 Lines, now at 7-6-3, it's a missed opportunity to consolidate their second-place position.

The narrative here belongs squarely to **Kosta Likourezos** of The Sahara. The man was a human highlight reel, potting an **even-strength hat trick** – scoring three of his team's five goals, including the game-winner in the third period at 11:33. This guy is playing on another level right now, boasting 7 points in just 4 games played, an efficiency rate of 1.75 Pts/G that rivals the league's best. His linemates, **Isaac Jeffers** (2 assists) and **Sam Goldstein** (1 assist), certainly fed him well. It's also worth noting **Ian Istvan** (1 Goal, 7 points on the season) and **Wil Nenadovic** (1 Goal, 6 points) contributed to The Sahara's offensive output, making it a well-rounded scoring effort.

On the flip side, 4 Lines showed resilience with **Shane Ferguson** (1 Goal, 1 Assist), **Thomas Hunter** (1 Goal, 1 Assist), **Jamie Poole** (1 Goal), and **Donald Houston Jr.** (1 Goal) all finding the back of the net. Ferguson, with 20 points in 9 games (2.22 Pts/G), remains an offensive juggernaut, but even he couldn't push his team over the finish line.

The penalty box saw some action early on. **Jamie Poole** of 4 Lines and **Mitchell Moloney** of The Sahara both decided to exchange pleasantries – and minor penalties for Unsportsmanlike Conduct – at the 11:35 mark of the first. This bit of mutual indiscretion, totaling 2 PIMs for each, certainly spiced things up. However, 4 Lines then decided to take it up a notch: **Jamie Wilson** collected a minor for Interference and another for Body Contact in the first two periods, giving 4 Lines a total of **6 PIMs** for the game. While The Sahara's season PIM count is 50, 4 Lines sits at 42. Wilson's two minors, adding 4 PIMs to his individual season total of 6, demonstrates a lack of discipline that can, and did, cost them crucial momentum.

**Referees Evan Benwell and Brad Kuchar** were officiating this one, marking the beginning of their busy week.

### Game 1173865: Don Cherry's (5) vs. Flat-Earthers (5) – A Point Earned, A Point Lost

This next Wednesday game, also at St. Mikes, was an absolute barn burner ending in a **5-5 tie** between Don Cherry's (ranked 1st) and the Flat-Earthers (ranked 3rd). For Don Cherry's, this tie keeps their impressive 10-1-6 record intact, maintaining their top spot with 26 points. For the Flat-Earthers, now at 7-6-3, it's a hard-fought point against the league leaders, showing they can go toe-to-toe with anyone, despite their minus-7 goal differential on the season.

The scoreboard lit up like a Christmas tree, with neither team backing down. **Anthony Pennino** was the catalyst for the Flat-Earthers, potting **two goals** (now 18 points on the season) and grabbing an assist. **Aaron Johnson** (1 Goal, 1 Assist), **Brandon Sanders** (1 Goal, 1 Assist), and **Marcus Simmonds** (1 Goal) rounded out their scoring. The Flat-Earthers demonstrated some depth in their offensive contributions, with four players scoring.

Not to be outdone, Don Cherry's saw **Cassady Louks** also pick up a **two-goal night** (11 points on the season). **Nik Tsatsos** (1 Goal, 6 points), **Sean Murphy** (1 Goal, 22 points), and **Koch Tsatsos** (1 Goal, 16 points) ensured Don Cherry's kept pace. The playmaking of **Michael Murphy** was evident with **two assists**, bringing his league-leading total to a tie with Charles Levy at 26 points.

Penalties were a bit lighter in this one, with **Jack Pirie** of Don Cherry's picking up a minor for Hooking and **Reid Chessell** of the Flat-Earthers getting one for High-Sticking. Each team recorded **2 PIMs** in total for the game. Interestingly, while the Flat-Earthers have the highest overall PIM count in the league at 63, they kept a relatively clean sheet against the league leaders, perhaps focusing on staying out of trouble to earn that crucial point.

**Referees Brad Kuchar and Evan Benwell** were again on the ice, clearly working the Wednesday double-header.

### Game 1173851: The Shockers (7) vs. Muffin Men (3) – A Shocking Display of Dominance

Monday night at St. Mikes brought us a blowout, with The Shockers delivering a resounding **7-3 defeat** to the Muffin Men. This win is a massive boost for The Shockers, now at 6-10-1 (13 points), keeping them in the hunt. For the Muffin Men, it's another tough loss, bringing their record to 7-9-1 (15 points) and showing a clear downward trend.

The story here is unequivocally **Caden Bower** for The Shockers. The man was a force of nature, scoring **four goals** in the game, an extraordinary individual performance. Bower, who has only played 7 games, now has an astonishing 14 points, giving him a ridiculous **2.0 Pts/G average**, ranking him among the elite in terms of efficiency. **Alex Matheson** (1 Goal, 12 points), **Levi Tobe** (1 Goal, 4 points), and a "Spare" player also chipped in goals, showcasing a dominant offensive display by The Shockers. **Nick Chong** was the primary setup man with **two assists**.

The Muffin Men found themselves overwhelmed, despite a spirited third-period effort where **Charles Levy** scored **two goals** (bringing his season total to 16, tied for the league lead in goals), and **Alan Wren** added another. However, by that point, the game was well out of reach. The Muffin Men's defensive structure, which has seen them concede 58 goals on the season (a 3.41 GFA), clearly needs some work. They currently sit at a goal differential of 0, but this game certainly didn't help.

Remarkably, this game was played entirely penalty-free. Not a single PIM recorded for either side. This could be interpreted as a testament to clean play, or perhaps, for the Muffin Men, a sign that they were simply too busy trying to keep up with Bower.

**Referees Brad Kuchar and Evan Benwell** were once again on assignment, completing their hat-trick of officiating duties for the week, with **Dan Hickox** as Convenor. These guys put in a shift!

## League Context & What's Trending

### The Shifting Sands of the Standings
**Don Cherry's** (10-1-6, 26 pts) still hold the top spot, but that tie against the Flat-Earthers shows they aren't invincible. The gap, however, remains significant, with a commanding 30 Goal Differential and a 0.765 Win Percentage.

**4 Lines** (7-6-3, 17 pts) maintain second place despite their loss, but The Sahara is nipping at their heels. The consistency issues remain.

**Flat-Earthers** (7-6-3, 17 pts) share second with 4 Lines on points, and that tie against Don Cherry's is a moral victory, showcasing their capacity to punch above their weight. Their league-high **63 PIMs** (including the 2 from this week) suggest a physical, sometimes undisciplined, style of play that might be costing them more consistently.

**The Sahara** (5-8-4, 14 pts) had a big week, climbing to 5th place. Their 5-4 win against 4 Lines, coupled with The Shockers' dominant performance, has compressed the middle of the table. They possess the league's best PK% at 91.7%, meaning they're good at killing those penalties, but still accumulating 50 PIMs on the season.

**The Shockers** (6-10-1, 13 pts) made the biggest jump this week, turning heads with that 7-3 thrashing. This is a team that could be finding its stride at a crucial time.

**The Muffin Men** (7-9-1, 15 pts) are sliding, their loss to The Shockers dropping them to 4th. They need to find their defensive game and fast.

### Individual Brilliance & Burgeoning Threats

The race for the scoring title is heating up. **Charles Levy** (Muffin Men) and **Michael Murphy** (Don Cherry's) are now neck and neck with **26 points** each. Levy's 16 goals lead the league, while Murphy's 12 assists show his playmaking prowess.

But let's talk about **Recent Successes** that demand attention:

*   **Kosta Likourezos (The Sahara):** His hat trick in just his 4th game of the season, now with 7 points, is statistically ludicrous. If he keeps showing up, The Sahara has a secret weapon.
*   **Caden Bower (The Shockers):** Four goals in one game, and a 2.0 Pts/G average in limited appearances (7 GP, 14 Pts). This kid is clearly making up for lost time and is an undeniable force.
*   **Anthony Pennino (Flat-Earthers):** His two-goal, one-assist performance against Don Cherry's shows he's a clutch player for the Flat-Earthers.

And for those on a **Downward Trend**:

*   **Muffin Men's Defense:** Giving up 7 goals, bringing their season total to 58 (tied for 3rd most goals against in the league) is not a recipe for success. They need to tighten things up from the top down.
*   **4 Lines' Penalty Discipline:** While not the highest PIMs in the league, **Jamie Wilson's** multiple minors in one game against The Sahara highlights a pattern that could plague them in tighter contests. When the margins are thin, those 2-minute minors are killers.

The league is a grind, and this week provided plenty of evidence that every point matters. We'll be back next week to see who's rising, who's falling, and which referee crew pulls the longest shifts. Until then, keep your heads up and your sticks on the ice. Or at least, try to keep them off opponents' shins.
