**The Low B Dispatch: DMHL Monday/Wednesday Low B**

## January 15, 2026: The Shockers Stun, Sahara Rises, and Flat-Earthers Level the Playing Field

This week in the Monday/Wednesday Low B saw a mix of dominant performances and nail-biting finishes, shaking up the middle of the pack while the top remains a tight race. All the action unfolded on the familiar ice of St. Mikes Arena, officiated cleanly by the duo of Kuchar and Benwell, whose light touch meant penalties rarely dictated play.

Monday night’s clash saw **The Shockers** deliver a resounding 7-3 defeat to the **Muffin Men**. Caden Bower was the undeniable force, netting a remarkable four goals, with Maxime Gagnon contributing two assists. For the Muffin Men, Charles Levy's two-goal effort was commendable but insufficient against the Shockers' offensive onslaught. The game was notably clean, with zero penalties called.

Wednesday presented two compelling matchups. First, **Don Cherry's** and the **Flat-Earthers** battled to a thrilling 5-5 tie. The Flat-Earthers, often facing skepticism, proved their resilience. Anthony Pennino scored twice, including a crucial late equalizer, ensuring his team salvaged a point against the league leaders. Michael Murphy provided two assists for Don Cherry's, who remain atop the standings but felt the pressure. Only two minor penalties were called, keeping the focus on even-strength play.

Later, **The Sahara** edged out **4 Lines** in a tight 5-4 contest. Kosta Likourezos was the hero for The Sahara, bagging a hat trick (including the game-winner), supported by Andrew Biggs' two assists. Shane Ferguson led the response for 4 Lines with a goal and an assist. This game, however, did see a rare double minor for unsportsmanlike conduct in the first period, suggesting a more spirited affair, though neither team capitalized on the resulting even-strength play. The Sahara's win gains them crucial ground in the standings.

**This Week's Three Stars:**
1.  **Caden Bower (The Shockers):** Four goals in a decisive victory against the Muffin Men. A singular, dominant offensive performance.
2.  **Kosta Likourezos (The Sahara):** A hat trick, including the game-winner, propelling his team to a vital win over 4 Lines.
3.  **Anthony Pennino (Flat-Earthers):** Two crucial goals, including the late equalizer, earning his team a valuable point against league-leading Don Cherry's. His persistent offensive drive, backed by his season-long grit, defines the productive agitator.
