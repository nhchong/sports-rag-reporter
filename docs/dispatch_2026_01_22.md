### Week in Review: Monday/Wednesday Low B – DMHL

### Standings Stir, Shutout Surprise, and a Forfeit Fizzle

This week’s Low B action offered a mix of outcomes, subtly reshaping the standings landscape. **Don Cherry's** tightened their grip on first place, securing a 1-0 forfeit win against **4 Lines** on Monday at St. Mikes. While an unconventional path to two points, it secures their 27 points. 4 Lines, unfortunately, lost ground, remaining at 18 points and third in the division.

Later Monday at UCC, **The Shockers** delivered a commanding 5-0 shutout over **The Sahara**. Caden Bower (1G, 2A) was exceptional, flanked by Nick Chong's two assists. Goals from Marcus Gwyn-Neumann, Gabe Fischer-Schmidt (shorthanded!), Levi Tobe, and Maxime Gagnon showcased a full-team effort. Despite incurring four penalties themselves to The Sahara's one, The Shockers' dominance was undeniable, narrowing their gap in sixth place with 13 points. The Sahara hold fifth with 14.

Wednesday's late game at St. Mikes saw the **Flat-Earthers** outmuscle the **Muffin Men** 4-2. Flat-Earthers saw a balanced attack with goals from Reid Chessell, Anthony Pennino, Daniel Solomos, and Ethan Hirst, with Chessell and Pennino each adding an assist. Charles Levy netted both for the Muffin Men, a strong individual outing insufficient to prevent the loss. A lone tripping minor to Ryan Irwin kept officiating low-key. Flat-Earthers consolidate second with 19 points, while the Muffin Men remain fourth at 16.
