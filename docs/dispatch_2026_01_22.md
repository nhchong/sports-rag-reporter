# The Weekly Wrap: Forfeits, Flat-Earthers, and a Shocking Shutout

Alright fellas, another week in the books, and if you thought your office politics were convoluted, just take a gander at the Low B standings. The ice may be freezing, but the action – or lack thereof – is heating up the narrative. Let's slice through the fluff and see what the data's screaming this week.

## A Ghost Game and a Growing Gap at the Top

We kicked things off with **Game ID 1176618**, a matchup that didn't even require skates. **Don Cherry's** squared off against **4 Lines**, or rather, they *didn't*. Don Cherry's banked a 1-0 win by forfeit. Let's be real, a win's a win, but it's hardly the stuff of legends.

For **Don Cherry's**, this is just another notch in their already impressive belt. They sit comfortably atop the league at Rank 1 with **26 points** and a stellar **0.765 Win Percentage**. Their **+30 Goal Differential** remains untouched, solidifying their status as the team to beat. Meanwhile, for **4 Lines**, this is a frustrating outcome. They remain at Rank 2 with **17 points**, now tied with the Flat-Earthers, but with one more game played and a loss tacked onto their record without a single puck drop. It’s a gut punch that puts pressure on them to perform in their next outing.

On the official front, we had **Brad Kuchar** and **Darcy McNamee** on referee duty, with **Dan Hickox** as convenor. Can't say they broke a sweat, but they certainly witnessed… nothing.

## Shockers Stun Sahara in a Five-Goal Blitz

Then came **Game ID 1176619**, where **The Shockers** delivered a decisive **5-0 shutout** against **The Sahara**. If you blinked, you probably missed a goal, or at least a flurry of frustrated Sahara players.

**The Shockers** (Rank 6, now with **15 points** from 18 games) certainly needed this. **Caden Bower** was a force, tallying a goal and an assist (1G, 1A), boosting his season total to **14 points** in just 7 games, maintaining an impressive **2.0 Pts/G**. Not far behind, **Nick Chong** dished out two assists, bringing his season total to **12 points**. **Alex Matheson** (1A, 12 pts total) and **Maxime Gagnon** (1G, 11 pts total) also contributed to the offensive outburst. The cherry on top? **Gabe Fischer-Schmidt** scored a short-handed goal, a delightful bit of opportunism that probably sent a shiver down The Sahara's bench. This team clearly found a gear they’ve been looking for.

Conversely, **The Sahara** (Rank 5, **14 points** from 18 games) looked completely lost. Despite boasting a league-leading **91.7% PK%**, they couldn't generate a single goal, exacerbating their league-worst **-27 Goal Differential**. Even their minimal penalty count this game – only **Yanir Levy's 2-minute High-Sticking** minor – couldn't save them. The Shockers, meanwhile, took a few liberties with **8 PIMs** (Kamil Paris, Keelan Hughes, Alex Matheson, Nick Chong), yet still managed to dominate the scoreboard. Sometimes discipline goes out the window when you’re just scoring at will.

This game was officiated by **Mark Donohoe** and **Eric Beltrami**, with **Cindy Brown** as convenor. They certainly earned their stripes on this one, unlike the officials in the earlier forfeit.

## Flat-Earthers Prove Their Point Against the Muffin Men

Finally, we had **Game ID 1176629**, a proper hockey contest between **Flat-Earthers** and **Muffin Men**, with the Flat-Earthers taking a **4-2 victory**.

**The Flat-Earthers** (now tied for Rank 2 with **19 points** from 17 games) showed up to play. **Anthony Pennino** (1G, 1A) continued his strong season, now sitting at **18 points** through 14 games. **Ethan Hirst** (1G, 1A) also had a multi-point night, bringing him to **14 points** in 12 games. **Reid Chessell** (1G) and **Daniel Solomos** (1G) rounded out the scoring, demonstrating a balanced attack. Critically, the Flat-Earthers played a remarkably clean game, incurring **zero penalty minutes**. Their focus on discipline clearly paid off.

For the **Muffin Men** (Rank 4, **15 points** from 18 games), it was a frustrating night. **Charles Levy** tried to put the team on his back, netting both of their goals and pushing his league-leading tally to **18 goals** on the season (**28 points total**). But even Levy's heroics weren't enough. They only managed one penalty – **Ryan Irwin's 2-minute Tripping** minor – which is hardly a major infraction, but it was enough to put them on the back foot against a disciplined opponent. Their season-long **0 Goal Differential** remains, which feels about right for a team that can be good, but just can't seem to break through consistently.

**Evan Benwell** and **Brad Kuchar** (yes, Kuchar again!) were the referees, with **Spencer Watt** as convenor. Kuchar must have a frequent skater pass for these rinks.

## The Big Picture: Standings Shake-Ups and Shifting Sands

This week solidified **Don Cherry's** position at the top, now with a commanding **9-point lead** over the freshly tied **4 Lines** and **Flat-Earthers**. The gap is widening, and the pursuit of first place is looking more like a distant dream for everyone else.

Individually, **Charles Levy** of the Muffin Men continues to light the lamp, now tied for the league lead in points with Michael Murphy (both with 28 pts), but holding the lead in goals (18). His individual brilliance is a clear **Recent Success** in an otherwise middling team performance.

On the **Downward Trend** side, **The Sahara** is really struggling to find the back of the net. Getting shut out 5-0 while having the worst goal differential in the league (**-27**) doesn't inspire confidence. Their potent **25.9% Power Play** and **91.7% Penalty Kill** percentages are impressive on paper, but if you can’t score at even strength and give up short-handed goals, those stats become moot.

The officiating assignments were interesting this week, with **Brad Kuchar** pulling double duty across two games. It's a reminder that even the men in stripes are putting in the work, navigating the wild swings of competitive, adult-league hockey.

So, there you have it. Don Cherry's keeps cruising, The Shockers inject some much-needed life into their season, and the Flat-Earthers are making a serious claim for second place. The middle of the pack is getting interesting, and as always, the numbers don't lie – even when they're telling us a team forfeited.

Catch you next week. Try not to trip anyone.
