The Low B Dispatch - Monday/Wednesday Low B

# Low B Roundup: Offensive Explosions Reshape the Standings

This week's DMHL Monday/Wednesday Low B slate at St. Mikes Arena delivered some high-octane offense and critical shifts in the league hierarchy, particularly in the congested middle.

Monday's 10:00 PM matchup saw **Don Cherry's** underscore their top-seed status with an 8-5 victory over **4 Lines**. Koch Tsatsos netted a hat-trick and Ben Pirie added two, reaffirming Don Cherry's offensive prowess. Ethan Lowe responded with two for 4 Lines, but it wasn't enough. Referees Mike Bonke and Russell Nichols largely let the play flow, with Pirie's late double-minor for slashing being the only significant call.

Wednesday's 9:00 PM game was a decisive 7-1 triumph for **The Shockers** against **The Sahara**. Patrick Mcmullan and Alex Matheson each scored twice, leading a relentless attack. Ian Istvan managed The Sahara's lone goal. Officiating by Carlos Verde and Evan Benwell kept penalties to a minimum with matching minors, but couldn't contain The Shockers' surge, which tightens the mid-table race.

The 10:00 PM nightcap brought the week's biggest statement: **Muffin Men** demolished the **Flat-Earthers** 8-1. Charles Levy exploded for five points (2G, 3A), with Owen Burry adding a goal and two assists. Aaron Johnson's solitary goal was all Flat-Earthers could muster. This penalty-free affair, again overseen by Verde and Benwell, was a masterclass from the Muffin Men, seriously boosting their playoff position and challenging Flat-Earthers' grip on second.
