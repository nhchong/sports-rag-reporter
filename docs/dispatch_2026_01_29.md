**The Low B Dispatch: Monday/Wednesday Low B Recap**

# St. Mike's Showdowns and Shorthanded Shenanigans

Another week of DMHL action at St. Mike's Arena delivered familiar dominance and some notable upsets. Don Cherry's, the division leaders, extended their cushion with a 5-3 win over The Sahara on Wednesday. Koch Tsatsos led the charge with two crucial third-period goals, complemented by three assists from Nik Tsatsos. For The Sahara, Sam Goldstein netted a pair, but two minor penalties against Don Cherry's had little impact on the final score.

Monday night saw the Flat-Earthers climb the standings with a decisive 6-3 victory over The Shockers. This game was a parade to the box, with The Shockers collecting four minors and the Flat-Earthers three. Crucially, Anthony Pennino and Daniel Solomos capitalized with shorthanded goals for the Flat-Earthers, turning disadvantage into opportunity. Brandon Sanders (1G, 2A) was particularly effective. Caden Bower notched both goals for The Shockers, who were undone by costly penalties and an inability to solve the Flat-Earthers' special teams.

Earlier on Monday, "4 Lines" and the "Muffin Men" battled to a 3-3 draw. Adam Miller (1G, 1A) highlighted a balanced attack for 4 Lines, while the Muffin Men saw contributions from Aaron Barrett and Cole Singleton. A late flurry of penalties against 4 Lines didn't swing the outcome, as the teams settled for a point each, maintaining their mid-table positions.

## The Low B Three Stars of the Week

*   **1st Star: Koch Tsatsos (Don Cherry's)** — With 2 goals and an assist, including a pair of timely third-period markers, Tsatsos was the offensive linchpin in his team's win, proving that the apple doesn't fall far from the Tsatsos tree in Don Cherry's lineup.

*   **2nd Star: Nik Tsatsos (Don Cherry's)** — Not to be outdone by his namesake, Nik registered three assists against The Sahara, quarterbacking the offense and demonstrating exceptional playmaking vision. Three primary helpers in a single game is a standout performance, regardless of position.

*   **3rd Star: Anthony Pennino (Flat-Earthers)** — Scoring a key shorthanded goal in the Flat-Earthers' win, Pennino (1G this week, 17 PIMs season total) exemplifies the "productive agitator" — someone who can get under opponents' skin and still deliver on the scoresheet.
